0@Gloomhaven@Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&#10;&#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZYp_3BTDGjh2unaZfZmuA__original/img/7d-lj5Gd1e8PFnD97LYFah2c45M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2437871.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZYp_3BTDGjh2unaZfZmuA__thumb/img/veqFeP4d_3zNhFc3GNBkV95rBEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2437871.jpg@3.8884@120@1@4
1@Food Chain Magnate@&quot;Lemonade? They want lemonade? What is the world coming to? I want commercials for burgers on all channels, every 15 minutes. We are the Home of the Original Burger, not a hippie health haven. And place a billboard next to that new house on the corner. I want them craving beer every second they sit in their posh new garden.&quot; The new management trainee trembles in front of the CEO and tries to politely point out that... &quot;How do you mean, we don't have enough staff? The HR director reports to you. Hire more people! Train them! But whatever you do, don't pay them any real wages. I did not go into business to become poor. And fire that discount manager, she is only costing me money. From now on, we'll sell gourmet burgers. Same crap, double the price. Get my marketing director in here!&quot;&#10;&#10;Food Chain Magnate is a heavy strategy game about building a fast food chain. The focus is on building your company using a card-driven (human) resource management system. Players compete on a variable city map through purchasing, marketing and sales, and on a job market for key staff members. The game can be played by 2-5 serious gamers in 2-4 hours.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Wtxml94LAXsIWQCxGPS63Q__original/img/9c-MJB6x54vN5eB-1hT4XQaHtP8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2649434.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Wtxml94LAXsIWQCxGPS63Q__thumb/img/LKU2KoMev222qUIKyNqaCF_ZLPY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2649434.png@4.2082@240@2@5
2@Power Grid@Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.&#10;&#10;The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yd6LuatytHRhcFCxCf-EEg__original/img/OS13C6W4i1XW__wWVVVaqF7BV0c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4459753.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yd6LuatytHRhcFCxCf-EEg__thumb/img/jWTonZ5oYNlPzpELKHIJGWSS0Y8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4459753.jpg@3.2606@120@2@6
3@CATAN@In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W3Bsga_uLP9kO91gZ7H8yw__original/img/xV7oisd3RQ8R-k18cdWAYthHXsA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2419375.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W3Bsga_uLP9kO91gZ7H8yw__thumb/img/8a9HeqFydO7Uun_le9bXWPnidcA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2419375.jpg@2.3063@120@3@4
4@Barrage@In the dystopic 1930s, the industrial revolution pushed the exploitation of fossil-based resources to the limit, and now the only thing powerful enough to quench the thirst for power of the massive machines and of the unstoppable engineering progress is the unlimited hydroelectric energy provided by the rivers.&#10;&#10;Barrage is a resource management strategic game in which players compete to build their majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity, and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnels connected to the energy turbines of their powerhouses.&#10;&#10;Each player represents one of the four international companies who are gathering machinery, innovative patents and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to collect and exploit the water of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers.&#10;&#10;Barrage includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms. First, the players must carefully plan their actions and handle their machinery, since both their action tokens and resources are stored on a Construction Wheel and will only be available after a full turn of the wheel. The better you manage your wheel, the earlier your resources and actions come back to you.&#10;&#10;Second, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches the downstream dams), raise the dams to increase their capacity, and build long tunnels to channel the water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed &mdash; its flow is just used to produce energy &mdash;, it is instead released back to the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players.&#10;&#10;Over five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing strategy.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jEPmWvvYpqkWrKOzqIHFsg__original/img/rkHKwkUqpQC7PAGG7n2gbrcQiUY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4336469.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jEPmWvvYpqkWrKOzqIHFsg__thumb/img/kMLIpeqA6UcUvQg2AdMwwQoEIfU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4336469.png@4.0685@120@1@4
5@Sleeping Gods@&quot;Are the stars unfamiliar here?&quot; she asked, and the sky grew suddenly dark, the star's patterns alien and exotic. &quot;This is the Wandering Sea. The gods have brought you here, and you must wake them if you wish to return home.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Sleeping Gods, you and up to 3 friends become Captain Sofi Odessa and her crew, lost in a strange world in 1929 on your steamship, the Manticore. You must work together to survive, exploring exotic islands, meeting new characters, and seeking out the totems of the gods so that you can return home.&#10;&#10;Sleeping Gods is a campaign game. Each session can last as long as you want. When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play solo or with friends throughout your campaign. It's easy to swap players in and out at will. Your goal is to find at least fourteen totems hidden throughout the world. Like reading a book, you'll complete this journey one or two hours at a time, discovering new lands, stories, and challenges along the way.&#10;&#10;Sleeping Gods is an atlas game. Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward.&#10;&#10;Sleeping Gods is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters. Your choices affect the characters and the plot of the game, and may help or hinder your chances of getting home!&#10;&#10;Welcome to a vast world.

6@Cosmic Encounter@Build a galactic empire...&#10;&#10;In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.&#10;&#10;This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more!&#10;&#10;In Cosmic Encounter, each player becomes the leader of one of dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power. On a player's turn, he or she becomes the offense. The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet. Both sides can invite allies and play cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory. And, because alliances are a key part of the game, multiple players can win together!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S8cE-Ld7XP5sVz-upKJ-Bg__original/img/c4ZrfOtpp6tDHLyMsKecc2ne370=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1521633.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S8cE-Ld7XP5sVz-upKJ-Bg__thumb/img/gE--xqnuor4bft2J361zxJJGCjM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1521633.jpg@2.5819@120@3@5
7@Agricola@Description from BoardgameNews&#10;&#10;In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__original/img/toobKoejPiHpfpHk4SYd1UAJafw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic831744.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__thumb/img/GHGdnCfeysoP_34gLnofJcNivW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic831744.jpg@3.637@150@1@5
8@The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine@In the co-operative trick-taking game The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine, the players set out as astronauts on an uncertain space adventure. What are the rumors regarding the unknown planet about? The eventful journey through space extends over 50 exciting missions. But this game can only be defeated by meeting common individual tasks of each player. In order to meet the varied challenges communication is essential in the team. But this is more difficult than expected in space.&#10;&#10;With each mission the game becomes more difficult. After each mission the game can be paused and continued later. During each mission it is not the number of tricks but the right tricks at the right time that count.&#10;&#10;The team completes a mission only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 50 missions, with three additional missions published in spielbox 2/2020.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/98LnQShydr11OBKS46xY-Q__original/img/Q-ZkgnuBu9OTBr7J3qnqPjqamAE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5687013.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/98LnQShydr11OBKS46xY-Q__thumb/img/et-fnuozyOdBOVL-5kSS3_7I8fw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5687013.jpg@1.9735@20@2@5
9@Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile@In Oath, one to six players guide the course of history in an ancient land. Players might take the role of agents bolstering the old order or scheme to bring the kingdom to ruin. The consequences of one game will ripple through those that follow, changing what resources and actions future players may have at their disposal and even altering the game's core victory condition.&#10;&#10;If a player seizes control by courting anarchy and distrust, future players will have to contend with a land overrun by thieves and petty warlords. In a later game, a warlord might attempt to found a dynasty, creating a line of rulers that might last generations or be crushed by the rise of a terrible, arcane cult.&#10;&#10;In Oath, there are no fancy production tricks, app-assisted mechanisms or production gimmicks. The game can be reset at any time and doesn't require the same play group from one game to the next. A player might use the fully-featured solo mode to play several generations during the week and then use that same copy of the game for Saturday game-night with friends. There are no scripted narratives or predetermined end points. The history embedded in each copy of Oath will grow to be as unique as the players who helped build it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gTxav_KKQK1rDg-XuCjCSA__original/img/lG-iXVzDlfFrD6VPggvg2WQ7228=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5164812.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gTxav_KKQK1rDg-XuCjCSA__thumb/img/tFTOAKG5aDXxYfNRmJNmfyxH83M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5164812.jpg@4.0588@150@1@6

12@Chinatown@This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.

15@Dominion (Second Edition)@&quot;You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&#10;&#10;&quot;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.'&quot;'&#10;&#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&#10;&#10;Dominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards.

These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack. The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (&quot;you may&quot; added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same).&#10;&#10;Dominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4dmyKfqQm_uxA1-chh4JeQ__original/img/5UxDHPldIiCb0uovIwzngR-jx5M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3187001.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4dmyKfqQm_uxA1-chh4JeQ__thumb/img/Td5CxjO0ZTIbwHNhk2ETEy1qYyg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3187001.jpg@2.1712@30@2@4
16@Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game@Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.&#10;&#10;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?&#10;&#10;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.&#10;&#10;Official Site, Rules &amp; FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp;esem=4&#10;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q2w2rFJiFI_uV89KP6ECg__original/img/MYuRAKLRAGlIQTph2XKWjzqT7sQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic354500.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q2w2rFJiFI_uV89KP6ECg__thumb/img/s1BljxEdoxQ1zGYiw05Qa9rg9hI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic354500.jpg@3.2502@180@3@6
17@Empire Builder@Epic Railroad Building in North America&#10;&#10;Discover a modern North American classic.  Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&#10;&#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WPfjWkfenHoUkqZByS5pyg__original/img/9QNa3OB2VNOwjTIzwoi-ARwn3Sw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic436693.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WPfjWkfenHoUkqZByS5pyg__thumb/img/Dwio9CMhMBURPvbxPc6wz_vfARQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic436693.jpg@2.6293@180@2@6
18@Kingdom Death: Monster@Kingdom Death: Monster is a fully cooperative tabletop hobby game experience.  Set in a unique nightmarish world devoid of most natural resources, you control a settlement at the dawn of its existence. Fight monsters, craft weapons and gear, and develop your settlement to ensure your survival from generation to generation.&#10;&#10;Campaign System&#10;Embark alone or with up to 3 friends (5 with game variant) on a 5-30-lantern-year campaign, with each year consisting of a cycle of hunt, showdown, and settlement phases. The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival.  During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style journey through various events and encounters.  Finally, when you meet the monster you're pursuing, you'll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive.  If your party lives, you'll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement.&#10;&#10;Monster AI System&#10;Each of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it's HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.&#10;&#10;Gear System&#10;In Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly.&#10;&#10;Story Event System&#10;40+ Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign. Story Events detail important evolutions in your civilization, introduce new monsters, and provide rich detail for your campaign.  Some will trigger automatically as you progress through the campaign, but most will be entirely based on choices players make.&#10;&#10;Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to key events that happen within the overall story. Some are triggered directly from the timeline and others from choices you make in game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LenzJBOHboAGU0cUIqAZPQ__original/img/-dnx4zkvdOn3CMVHpXIfESazj40=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2931007.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LenzJBOHboAGU0cUIqAZPQ__thumb/img/Z3yFJIp9rmSmcGoTiqGeTkKCnQU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2931007.jpg@4.2602@180@1@4
19@Decrypto@Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team. In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;tent&quot;, and &quot;son&quot;, then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.&#10;&#10;Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, &quot;sucker-prince-stake&quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)&#10;&#10;The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__original/img/lL6QJ69UmZT7CeljUcjyA47b-e0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3759421.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__thumb/img/O5XHaPOALYquS058qcXWVm5b_k4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3759421.jpg@1.7782@45@3@8
20@Glass Road@The game Glass Road commemorates the 700-year-old tradition of glass-making in the Bavarian Forest. (Today, the &quot;Glass Road&quot; is a route through the Bavarian forest that takes visitors to many of the old glass houses and museums of that region.) You must skillfully manage your glass and brick production in order to build the right structures that help you keep your business flowing. Cut the forest to keep the fires burning in the ovens, and spread and remove ponds, pits, and groves to supply yourself with the items you need. Fifteen specialists are there at your side to carry out your orders...&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game consists of four building periods. Each player has an identical set of fifteen specialist cards, and each specialist comes with two abilities. At the beginning of each building period, you choose a hand of five specialists. If during this building period, you play a specialist that no other player has in hand, you may use both abilities on that card; if two or more players play the same specialist, each of them may use only one of the two abilities. Exploiting the abilities of these specialists lets you collect resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g., ponds and pits), and build a variety of buildings, which come in three types:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Processing buildings&#10;    &quot;Immediate&quot; buildings with a one-time effect &#10;    Buildings that provide bonus points at the end of the game for various accomplishments&#10;&#10;&#10;Mastering the balance of knowing the best specialist card to play and being flexible about when you play it &mdash; together with assembling a clever combination of buildings &mdash; is the key to this game.&#10;&#10;The 2021 edition of Glass Road includes previously released promotional material: the Oktoberfest and Adventskalender tiles and the Harlekin card for use in the solitaire version of the game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qJCgEh5Icl7Ed1z2F56yxg__original/img/uz0zO0sycM6HZNA3HTWW7-_ur_Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5895433.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qJCgEh5Icl7Ed1z2F56yxg__thumb/img/yGVr4jO888pg1GmCnukXbubTZmM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5895433.jpg@2.9712@80@1@4

Under constant threat of attack, you must conquer new lands, oversee dramatic scientific and cultural advances, and lead your people into the era of empire. Expand too rapidly, and unrest will bring your civilization to its knees; build up too slowly, however, and you might find yourself a mere footnote of history. As one of eight radically asymmetric civilizations, you will compete to become the most dominant empire the world has ever seen.&#10;&#10;Imperium: Legends is a standalone game that contains the Arthurian, Atlantian, Egyptian, Mauryan, Minoan, Olmec, Qin, and Utopian civilizations and an individual solo opponent behaving as each nation.

22@Fields of Arle@Welcome to Arle&#10;In Fields of Arle, created by Uwe Rosenberg, one to two players live as farmers in the small and peaceful town of Arle in East Frisia. The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity, with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax, or find other ways to make the most of the small town&rsquo;s prosperity.&#10;&#10;Work the Land&#10;Whether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise, always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.&#10;&#10;Tools of the Trade&#10;At the outset of each half year, you&rsquo;ll choose how you&rsquo;d like to spend that time working. There are many ways to build your fortune. Use the Master space to increase the tools at your disposal, focus on the Cattle Trainer to make the most of your livestock, or build up your fleet of vehicles and ship out goods. Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall, and sheer your sheep in spring. At the end of each half year, you&rsquo;ll need to take stock of your progress by unloading your vehicles and feeding your family and animals, so keep an eye on the season and do your best to keep the farm growing and everyone well fed!&#10;&#10;Travel and Prosper&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve made headway in clearing fields and stocking up goods, it's time to make your products available to potential buyers. The more vehicles you have, the more goods you can ship. Send things into the wide world to increase your Travel Experience and grant you points over the course of the four and a half years of the game. Build up your farm and your vehicles and get your goods out into the world to make the most of every season. There are many roads to success in Fields of Arle, so pick your path, work the land, and enjoy the friendly competition as you strive to make your fortune!&#10;&#10;- from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0w8go6cfvlpgJKydHUkDtA__original/img/322N77t8F7uTev-U_WCqX5uqmEE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2225968.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0w8go6cfvlpgJKydHUkDtA__thumb/img/0z1o-kU2xYwmVO8oNszdt1V4K54=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2225968.png@3.8655@120@1@2
23@1829@1829 was the first of the 18xx series. First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.&#10;&#10;This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.&#10;&#10;The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.&#10;&#10;Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.&#10;&#10;In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.&#10;&#10;The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.&#10;&#10;Expanded By:&#10;&#10;    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)&#10;    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    1829 Conversion Kit&#10;    1829 Northern Board&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CokqERxkceU9XKnTT3rhLQ__original/img/SDNB-lOSU01uvi3gFZDokcQPcpI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic224206.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CokqERxkceU9XKnTT3rhLQ__thumb/img/TP3yYmJAxmfwN7t96tMnoCTv7Uw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic224206.jpg@3.7619@360@3@9
24@Le Havre@In Le Havre, a player's turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action. As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.&#10;&#10;After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y7Rqd3S6J7vyVhicR1bqTQ__original/img/tQFXv1w2R-J-1cjyaKG9LAS2UOs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6091101.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y7Rqd3S6J7vyVhicR1bqTQ__thumb/img/w1iHoYZCVTDZI6gsPuxOScA7FqU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6091101.jpg@3.732@150@1@5
25@Race for the Galaxy@2018 UPDATE: The second edition of the game is improved for CVD (color blindness) and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds. The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.&#10;&#10;UPC 655132003018&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__original/img/Vh-DCkTPa8OU45LaJdUywwhiYqE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5261714.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__thumb/img/xLs-ldTPwaADbvzkOpF0sgWzwck=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5261714.jpg@2.9887@60@2@4

Over time, the players develop their farms and deliver goods to the village. Players are vying to earn the title of &quot;La Granja&quot; for their country estate!&#10;&#10;Over the course of 6 game rounds, players will expand their farm by adding fields, farm extensions, market barrows, and helpers.  They will earn VPs by delivering goods to the village of Esporles.  It is important to observe the actions of other players, manipulate turn order, and adjust your strategy based on the dice and cards.&#10;&#10;La Granja is a fascinating game that requires careful planning.

29@Stone Age@The &quot;Stone Age&quot; times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.&#10;&#10;In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.&#10;&#10;Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/elmZegVZ6gp4_5izUgxGQQ__original/img/cR92Dm6yQ3Lgxt1yR81zUb0ooqQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1632539.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/elmZegVZ6gp4_5izUgxGQQ__thumb/img/MXq3DEKWIozO-PmB4S64BiE5fd0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1632539.jpg@2.4667@90@2@4
30@Obsession@You are the head of a respected but troubled family estate in mid-19th century Victorian England. After several lean decades, family fortunes are looking up! Your goal is to improve your estate so as to be in better standing with the truly influential families in Derbyshire.&#10;&#10;Obsession is a game of 16 to 20 turns in which players build a deck of Victorian gentry (British social upper class), renovate their estate by acquiring building tiles from a centralized builders' market, and manipulate an extensive service staff of butlers, housekeepers, underbutlers, maids, valets, and footmen utilizing a novel worker placement mechanic. Successfully hosting prestigious social activities such as Fox Hunts, Music Recitals, Billiards, Political Debates, and Grand Balls increases a player's wealth, reputation, and connections among the elite.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose a building tile representing a room or outdoor space in and around their 19th century British country house. The tile chosen dictates the event that can be hosted and the guests to be invited. Players must carefully plan, however, to have the proper staff available to service the event and support guests as needed. The reward for success is new investment opportunities, permitting further renovation of the estate (acquisition of more valuable/powerful building tiles), an increase in reputation in the county, an expanding circle of influential acquaintances, and a larger and highly-trained domestic staff.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, a competitive courtship for the hand of the most eligible young gentleman and lady in the county presents specific renovation and reputation objectives. The player who best meets these objectives while accumulating victory points will win the hand of the wealthy love interest and the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sy89BiuZXfbSnG7Cag9tBQ__original/img/uArsqbWyUALa982zGWsy8QQWnjE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5902073.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sy89BiuZXfbSnG7Cag9tBQ__thumb/img/eTnMwfCC2jCGDPXC08SIaMXNOTM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5902073.png@3.1171@90@1@4

33@The Resistance@The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!&#10;&#10;The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.&#10;&#10;Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.&#10;&#10;Rule Correction:&#10;&#10;For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAPTkL2BR3snLO71dkH8rw__original/img/_UahoIUTqh39xRqzCc2jwgdYbSA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2576459.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAPTkL2BR3snLO71dkH8rw__thumb/img/5lDn1W82rlLXtVG7nPIYR9Orn-4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2576459.jpg@1.6@30@5@10
34@Azul@Introduced by the Moors, azuleijos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.&#10;&#10;In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aPSHJO0d0XOpQR5X-wJonw__original/img/AkbtYVc6xXJF3c9EUrakklcclKw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6973671.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aPSHJO0d0XOpQR5X-wJonw__thumb/img/ccsXKrdGJw-YSClWwzVUwk5Nh9Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6973671.png@1.7621@45@2@4
35@Star Realms@Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).&#10;&#10;Star Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat. It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!&#10;&#10;Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios. Also, in the newest version, there are new ways to play that allow up to 6 players with modes like Boss, Hunter, and Free for All. You can also add Star Realms Colony Wars to the deck to make it 4 players. This is the first game of the Star Realms series. When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&#10;&#10;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.&#10;&#10;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EsJqPL5CB_TMt0MYL-lnVg__original/img/QXgamCDRuBoRJyU1PQjeh58Pvr8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1903816.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EsJqPL5CB_TMt0MYL-lnVg__thumb/img/s_CE1b1XXUnYj9auTPhLrvkNsYA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1903816.jpg@1.9333@20@2@2

38@Biblios@THE GAME CONCEPT&#10;You are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.&#10;&#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or fewer Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;GAME CHARACTERISTICS&#10;The game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy. It plays differently from 2-4 players, but each game is equally fun and challenging.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w9pHmbMbHEFYtuOUcWcruA__original/img/jOmzNb1JROlzeqEmCDScX_IkHVU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic759154.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w9pHmbMbHEFYtuOUcWcruA__thumb/img/BYid-ptJy9xNI_kK3IDWOGLWJVM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic759154.jpg@1.6844@30@2@4
39@Five Tribes@Crossing into the Land of 1001 Nights, your caravan arrives at the fabled Sultanate of Naqala. The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!&#10;&#10;Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard &quot;worker placement&quot; genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place &ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.&#10;&#10;As befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dmo-WD6HZHVUPrbVHunaTw__original/img/PS9HXrThM8Pepbd-cuA1tX8KCYU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2055255.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dmo-WD6HZHVUPrbVHunaTw__thumb/img/I6KVJlQgS1GfWDPSWAFNqce4Cgc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2055255.jpg@2.8519@80@2@4
40@Space Base@In Space Base, players assume the roles of Commodores of a small fleet of ships. Ships begin docked at their stations and are then deployed to sectors as new ships are commissioned under your command. Use cargo vessels to engage in trade and commerce; mining vessels to build reoccurring base income; and carriers to spread your influence. Establish new colonies for a new Commodore in a sector to gain even more influence. Gain enough influence and you can be promoted to Admiral!&#10;&#10;Space Base is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play dice game using the core &quot;I roll, everyone gets stuff&quot; mechanism seen in other games. It's also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach. Ultimately, Space Base is a game you can just start playing and teach everyone how to play in the first round or two and has a satisfying blend of dice-chucking luck and challenging strategic choices.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHhQxXVjiaa6C-04nGiIWw__original/img/QyWen0FVOKD_4wf7Na7fdsMTjis=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6640638.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHhQxXVjiaa6C-04nGiIWw__thumb/img/rgETRyeuYs_wiZ5y-9Zj5H8kyFo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6640638.jpg@2.1034@60@2@5
41@Gravwell: Escape from the 9th Dimension@In Gravwell, players command spaceships that have been pulled through a black hole, transporting them into a different dimension. With each ship lacking fuel to get home, each player must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using the gravity of the dimension and what little resources they have in order to reach the warp gate that will take them home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship! As a grim reminder of the cost of failing to escape, the frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route &mdash; but with careful card play, you can slingshot past these derelict craft and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!&#10;&#10;Gravwell uses 26 alphabetized cards to determine movement order and thrust; most cards move your ship towards the nearest object, but a few move you away from it. At the start of each round, players draft fuel cards, picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible; you get some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships, but you won't know which moves you'll be forced to make when you draft your cards!&#10;&#10;During a round, each player will play all of their fuel cards in the order of their choosing. During each phase of a round, each player chooses one card, then all cards are revealed and resolved in alphabetical order. When your opponents move in ways you didn't expect, you won't always be heading in the direction you thought you would! Each player holds an &quot;Emergency Stop&quot; card that they may tactically play only once per round to avoid such a situation.&#10;&#10;Whoever first reaches the warp gate wins, but if no one has escaped after six rounds, then the player who is closest to the gate wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3SZ3nWQTVHNlXLgk0fl4Tg__original/img/FqVeUj6m4P4ZFysUeyuO9TDESbU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2237646.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3SZ3nWQTVHNlXLgk0fl4Tg__thumb/img/4LHnCJQp7GKg0f1SP68DhgprWQQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2237646.png@1.7373@45@1@4
42@Lost Cities@Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AL5D-dXabY-Lk3PqIFk_0g__original/img/PdGBQ7xc0GA9ndKnnInx_sQwvl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4597095.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AL5D-dXabY-Lk3PqIFk_0g__thumb/img/Q-76aN92M3OveMp26t7b0i7V-i4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4597095.jpg@1.4861@30@2@2
43@Keyflower@Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&#10;&#10;Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HbfgxDJZQnNEZQKvpmJxQg__original/img/HsrtfanhKfXX07zNEm-xZpSbxyY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2278942.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HbfgxDJZQnNEZQKvpmJxQg__thumb/img/5t1MtJEDdhSgtyJlmu3Hu1qR_ZQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2278942.jpg@3.3442@120@2@6
44@Ark Nova@In Ark Nova, you will plan and design a modern, scientifically managed zoo. With the ultimate goal of owning the most successful zoological establishment, you will build enclosures, accommodate animals, and support conservation projects all over the world. Specialists and unique buildings will help you in achieving this goal.&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of five action cards to manage their gameplay, and the power of an action is determined by the slot the card currently occupies. The cards in question are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    CARDS: Allows you to gain new zoo cards (animals, sponsors, and conservation project cards).&#10;    BUILD: Allows you to build standard or special enclosures, kiosks, and pavilions.&#10;    ANIMALS: Allows you to accommodate animals in your zoo.&#10;    ASSOCIATION: Allows your association workers to carry out different tasks.&#10;    SPONSORS: Allows you to play a sponsor card in your zoo or to raise money.&#10;&#10;&#10;255 cards featuring animals, specialists, special enclosures, and conservation projects, each with a special ability, are at the heart of Ark Nova. Use them to increase the appeal and scientific reputation of your zoo and collect conservation points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoU8p28Sk1s8MSvoM4N8pQ__original/img/g4S18szTdrXCdIwVKzMKrZrYAcM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6293412.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoU8p28Sk1s8MSvoM4N8pQ__thumb/img/4KuHNTWSMPf8vTNDKSRMMI3oOv8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6293412.jpg@3.7022@150@1@4
45@Similo@Similo  is a co-operative deduction game, and each version of the game &mdash; e.g., Fables, History, Myths &mdash; comes with a deck of thirty cards, beautifully illustrated by Na&iuml;ade, showing the portrait and the name of a series of characters with a common theme.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to make the other players guess one secret character (out of the twelve characters on display in the middle of the table) by playing other character cards from your hand as clues, stating whether they are similar to or different from the secret character. After each turn, the other players must remove one or more characters from the table until only the right one remains and you win &mdash; or it is removed and you lose!&#10;&#10;You can play with one of the Similo sets on its own, using the cards from, say, Fables both for the characters being laid out and for the clues being given to the guessers, or you can use the cards from one set for the twelve characters on display and the cards from another set as the clues. The game is far trickier this way!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fl0hNCmltu2hpcmXaVnmLg__original/img/1kS0DQYV4y8HQdAmSlNhOW01Lhg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6417388.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fl0hNCmltu2hpcmXaVnmLg__thumb/img/Nwxz6SRTlKky0ynhYUEk2ooRZc4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6417388.png@1.04@15@2@8
46@Lisboa@Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of Lisboa after the great earthquake of 1755.&#10;&#10;On November 1, 1755, Lisbon suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5&ndash;9.0, followed by a tsunami and three days of fires. The city was almost totally destroyed. The Marques of Pombal &mdash; Sebasti&atilde;o Jos&eacute; de Carvalho e Melo &mdash; was the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the King put him in charge of the reconstruction of Lisbon. The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew, with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings, but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune, but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs.&#10;&#10;Lisboa is played on a real map of downtown Lisbon. During the planning of the downtown project, the type of business permitted in each street was previously determined. The economic motor is driven by the wealth of the royal treasure and this treasure is controlled by player actions during the game, making each game a totally different experience. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds and whoever gathers the most wigs by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Lisboa is played in rounds. Each round, all players play one turn. They may place one card on their display or replace one card from this display. During the game, players schedule hearings to get character favors, such as commerce, construction, and openings. The iconic buildings score the stores and stores provide income to the players. Players need to manage influence, construction licenses, store permits, church power, workers and money, with the workers' cost being dependent on the prestige of the players.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OrHS8_a1CqSGiXeTfCk0Wg__original/img/hVArRkZYHiPTGTfi0DPR58i4o44=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3209553.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OrHS8_a1CqSGiXeTfCk0Wg__thumb/img/ZBTT0qZcD5HMFlhFN7PLMe6zXvg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3209553.jpg@4.5768@120@1@4
47@Oceans@Three years in the making, Oceans is a stand-alone game in the award-winning Evolution series.  With over 120 works of art, 40 scenarios cards, and more than 100 unique trait cards, Oceans is the most ambitious project North Star Games has ever tackled.&#10;&#10;Theme&#10;Oceans depicts the boundaries between the known world near the ocean&rsquo;s surface, and the mysteries lurking in Earth&rsquo;s deepest unexplored region. Enter a vast, underwater cosmos: a mysterious interconnected world of sharp teeth, glowing eyes, and black ink, where your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the unknown.&#10;&#10;The foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis. Every other species in the ocean is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded Apex Predator. And even bigger than Apex Predators are enormous Whales that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path. This ecosystem mimics the known world near the surface.&#10;&#10;But there is more if you are willing to dive deeper...&#10;&#10;Oceans also includes a deck of 100 unique power cards called The Deep that represents the unknown. These powerful cards break the seams of the reality you've come to accept, ranging from astonishing things found in the ocean, to the fantastical Kraken or Leviathan.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Oceans is an interactive engine builder, where players evolve their species in a continually changing ecosystem. Players must adapt their interconnected ecosystem to survive against the inevitable march of time (Aging), as well as a multitude of predators looking for food.&#10;&#10;During the first half of the game, players use traits from a deck of Surface cards to modify their species.  With only 12 Surface traits, it&rsquo;s easy to wade into your first game without being overwhelmed by new cards. These traits were chosen for their rich thematic interconnections, providing synergistic card play that mimics an oceanic ecosystem.  The Surface traits bring stability to the game environment.&#10;&#10;During the second half of the game, players can use power cards from The Deep to disrupt the stability. With over 100 unique traits in The Deep, players will slowly discover game-altering traits over the course of many games.  These traits were designed to evoke wonder and disbelief - to spark your imagination as you consider the fantastic synergies that are possible in Oceans.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are 2 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate and deactivate at various points during the game. The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game.&#10;&#10;The Evolution Series&#10;Oceans is a stand-alone game in the Evolution series, but it's a vast departure from other games in the series. The turn structure has been simplified, the game play is much more forgiving, and the web of interconnections has increased dramatically. Whereas Evolution has the feeling of a traditional back-and-forth battle game like Magic: The Gathering,  Oceans has the feel of an interactive engine builder where everything is interconnected, and where your engine must continually adapt to a changing environment.&#10;&#10;Join the Oceans Discord community for rule questions, strategy discussions, and to get involved in future playtesting.&#10;&#10;https://discord.gg/GMaDycjKBV&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1J7_qmdohyypZNyvu8B45A__original/img/N4cHTwdthImTVqNrJUN9jQDskRc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4382323.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1J7_qmdohyypZNyvu8B45A__thumb/img/ASgVEQj-H2lzopAgm-_QgqEBVvI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4382323.jpg@2.8772@90@2@4
48@Puerto Rico@In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__original/img/DOgIp57F7tKZvxeITGAd3e_Q9as=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic158548.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__thumb/img/5fLo89ChZH6Wzukk36bhZ-EpBS0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic158548.jpg@3.275@150@3@5
49@Too Many Bones@Too Many Bones comes loaded for bear by breaking into a new genre: the dice-builder RPG. This game takes everything you think you know about dice-rolling and turns it on its head. Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous &quot;baddie&quot; responsible.&#10;&#10;Team up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign. With over 100+ unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from, every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out. Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wKwRk0wYBcrtLAfgn4PCdg__original/img/Wpp0vzsVe4HxXGUqiZ1hDvwAHZU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6624445.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wKwRk0wYBcrtLAfgn4PCdg__thumb/img/mJNzYNKvYWDlaaD12V32BJ453d0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6624445.png@3.859@120@1@4
50@Innovation@This game by Carl Chudyk is a journey through innovations from the stone age through modern times.  Each player builds a civilization based on various technologies, ideas, and cultural advancements, all represented by cards.  Each of these cards has a unique power which will allow further advancement, point scoring, or even attacking other civilizations.  Be careful though, as other civilizations may be able to benefit from your ideas as well!&#10;&#10;To win, you must score achievements, which you can attain by amassing points or by meeting certain criteria with the innovations you have built.  Plan your civilization well, and outmaneuver your opponents, and with some luck you will achieve victory!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YBE-vyyYRANWO2NXSQQghg__original/img/-Ec777H5hg1pmx6kQ0PI2A9Iroc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2966859.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YBE-vyyYRANWO2NXSQQghg__thumb/img/GmRDNEKangi2w4daNGHCQiH5h_I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2966859.png@2.7572@60@2@4
51@El Grande@In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO282hlXR3RiknU5W4GZjg__original/img/TCTXvYRQGWMAngXuHZcIXRknfpc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5373572.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO282hlXR3RiknU5W4GZjg__thumb/img/3mn0EVxxfT94rit8VHiyEYztGeg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5373572.png@3.0427@120@2@5
52@Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game@&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__original/img/NjrnSg1aeia8I4eETDU3I1Br7a8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3016500.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__thumb/img/foFGN8KwmN8BaYNpolq0HcMba4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3016500.jpg@3.0127@120@2@5
53@Blood on the Clocktower@In the quiet village of Ravenswood Bluff, &zwnj;a demon walks amongst you...&#10;&#10;During a hellish thunderstorm, on the stroke of midnight, there echoes a bone-chilling scream. The townsfolk rush to investigate and find the town storyteller murdered, their body impaled on the hands of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. A Demon is on the loose, murdering by night and disguised in human form by day. Some have scraps of information. Others have abilities that fight the evil or protect the innocent. But the Demon and its evil minions are spreading lies to confuse and breed suspicion. Will the good townsfolk put the puzzle together in time to execute the true demon and save themselves? Or will evil overrun this once peaceful village?&#10;&#10;Blood on the Clocktower is a bluffing game enjoyed by 5 to 20 players on opposing teams of Good and Evil, overseen by a Storyteller player who conducts the action and makes crucial decisions. The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they outnumber the townfolk.&#10;&#10;During a 'day' phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player's execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. Of a 'night' time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.&#10;&#10;The Storyteller uses the game's intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board. Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts trying to win from beyond the grave.&#10;&#10;If you arrive late to a game, you can enter after it's started as a powerful Traveller character with unusual talents and questionable allegiances. Each character comes with their own special ability and no two players in a game are ever the same character.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HINb2nkFn5IiZxAlzQIs4g__original/img/e7izEwSmnBPiErsIF6hlWbgybBE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7009391.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HINb2nkFn5IiZxAlzQIs4g__thumb/img/cRCX-PIROiSFG5aLvwkn2O7tHsg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7009391.jpg@2.9889@120@5@20
54@Calico@Calico is a puzzly tile-laying game of quilts and cats.&#10;&#10;In Calico, players compete to sew the coziest quilt as they collect and place patches of different colors and patterns. Each quilt has a particular pattern that must be followed, and players are also trying to create color and pattern combinations that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also able to attract the cuddliest cats!&#10;&#10;Turns are simple. Select a single patch tile from your hand and sew it into your quilt, then draw another patch into your hand from the three available. If you are able to create a color group, you may sew a button onto your quilt. If you are able to create a pattern combination that is attractive to any of the cats, it will come over and curl up on your quilt! At the end of the game, you score points for buttons, cats, and how well you were able to complete your unique quilt pattern.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/t8bTlZmxz6PiskMSjcBHcw__original/img/fDRiccme7OA8fWdl8FVCokv5eko=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4815033.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/t8bTlZmxz6PiskMSjcBHcw__thumb/img/TByBGUDO_jNVxDaOviRWOFtu9fk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4815033.jpg@2.1937@45@1@4
55@Freedom: The Underground Railroad@Early in the history of the United States, slavery was an institution that seemed unmovable but with efforts of men and women across the country, it was toppled. In Freedom: The Underground Railroad, players are working to build up the strength of the Abolitionist movement through the use of notable figures and pivotal events. By raising support for the cause and moving slaves to freedom in Canada, the minds of Americans can be changed and the institution of slavery can be brought down.&#10;&#10;Freedom is a card-driven, cooperative game for one to four players in which the group is working for the abolitionist movement to help bring an end to slavery in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game.&#10;&#10;Players need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause.&#10;&#10;The goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations.&#10;&#10;Through careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eEUq1DqkPjVdSTJT4wp1zg__original/img/43O0Wj3fkQZaqYGVjWFL-DP5j5w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1478723.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eEUq1DqkPjVdSTJT4wp1zg__thumb/img/GnUZDpuILEw0EMvhmskCfve3l4w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1478723.jpg@2.9036@120@1@4
56@Can't Stop@In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nMitZr9Lu4Ux7LLqBy7Z8A__original/img/A_bSjGJJXDFfSocVclabxi8ArY8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6875169.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nMitZr9Lu4Ux7LLqBy7Z8A__thumb/img/mLHWOFfdxrWljImkFZ2ulIhHt7A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6875169.png@1.1534@30@2@4

58@Nations@From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought, and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!&#10;&#10;Nations is an intense historical board game for 1&ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.&#10;&#10;Gameplay introduction&#10;&#10;Players choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Buy a card&#10;     Deploy a worker&#10;     Hire an architect for a wonder&#10;     Special action provided by a card&#10;&#10;&#10;Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.&#10;&#10;When all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;See 'More information' below for link to rules, etc.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-hn7gA50ci0n7j9u_-jHhA__original/img/1RkLWWHzepOqacKarc1176UofVs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1591406.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-hn7gA50ci0n7j9u_-jHhA__thumb/img/rJqh_lHJ45NZHtxC5uq8xH2_Hzk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1591406.png@3.5426@200@1@5
59@Time's Up!@Time's Up! is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game's three rounds.&#10;&#10;In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;Time's Up! is based on the public domain game known as Celebrities.  Also known as Salad Bowl or Fish Bowl.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eXgj9wE-fRfd4ZfW6PcjIw__original/img/0MM3j-vUQmrabkHVSC0m49cH4TQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3690440.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eXgj9wE-fRfd4ZfW6PcjIw__thumb/img/-eVeJ2xAfaLeEtO5EutEIi1Ce5M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3690440.jpg@1.2036@90@4@18
60@Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game@Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, Red Skull in the base game), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&#10;&#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all lose.&#10;&#10;Hero decks in the base game: Gambit, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Emma Frost, Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Storm, Captain America, Nick Fury, Rogue, Cyclops, Hulk, Wolverine, Deadpool&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZrRidumkzu62HuwKdgQpHA__original/img/FqPcmpzntFV1FDR6dniHGKvNwvI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1430769.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZrRidumkzu62HuwKdgQpHA__thumb/img/Q9zldSDfcsSXiD6SC4MU-dwCl5g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1430769.jpg@2.4336@60@1@5
61@Aladdin's Dragons@After the immediate response to Richard Breese's Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Gl&#195;&#188;ck contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game.  Aladdin's Dragons, or Morgenland in the original German, is the product of their cooperation.&#10;&#10;The game features players putting numbered bidding chips face-down onto the board sequentially.  After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved.  The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game.  The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions.  The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2001.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Keydom&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Aladdin's Dragons (card game version by same name as board game)&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:    (Buy One)&#10;&#10;      Aladdin's Dragons fan&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GFgQQ4ZMH8kr3LsGvYHZHw__original/img/aGawfUSiBKA_0TuH0A2k-NaaoeE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic143493.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GFgQQ4ZMH8kr3LsGvYHZHw__thumb/img/Cwelgy3mEzc1hUD5z30pKMuvqtQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic143493.jpg@2.4671@90@3@5
62@Maracaibo@Maracaibo, a strategy game for 1-4 players by Alexander Pfister, is set in the Caribbean during the 17th century. The players try to increase their influence in three nations in four rounds with a play time of 40 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;The players sail on a round course through the Caribbean, e.g., you have city tiles where you are able to perform various&nbsp;actions or deliver goods to. One special feature is an implemented quest mode over more and various tiles, which tells the player, who chase after it, a little story.&#10;&#10;As a player, you move with your ship around the course, managing it by using cards like in other games from Alexander Pfister.&#10;&#10;&#10;NOTE: The Spanish and Portuguese editions of Maracaibo contain La Armada mini-expansion packaged inside the base game's box.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMNa0k05zMdKgSEp26Q3Tw__original/img/yhnCcq9UplffqjSCe08mjTFvgOM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4917407.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMNa0k05zMdKgSEp26Q3Tw__thumb/img/lVlnhYyxlZb3WuKZJHLoJcFHEjs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4917407.jpg@3.8981@120@1@4
63@Victory in the Pacific@&quot;Victory in the Pacific&quot; is a simple strategic wargame covering the Pacific Theater of World War 2.  It is a successor to the system developed in &quot;War at Sea&quot; which covers the Battle of the Atlantic.&#10;&#10;The game divides the Pacific into 13 sea areas.  Each turn the players move their ships, land based air and marines from the ports and bases (which are located on the borders of sea areas) to one of the areas.&#10;&#10;Ships can either be patrollers  (the only ships that will take control of area after battle, but they must commit their move first) or raiders.&#10;&#10;After all ships have been moved, the players dice off determine whether a day battle (where air power is decisive) or night battle (when ship board gunnery rules) is fought.  After a number of rounds, until one side or the other retreats or loses all of his ships, the player with patrolling ships left takes control of the area and a scores a number of &quot;Points of Control&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Japanese will almost always take a large lead that will be inevitably turned back by the Americans as they get large numbers of carriers as the game goes on.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 2&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_QJdkcAaSOi_ir5zF-_U1g__original/img/JAp-3D2nybaovBQzwmqs2w4pu6o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic188896.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_QJdkcAaSOi_ir5zF-_U1g__thumb/img/R1b-n3W70HGFX22-4ZWGJeDX4dk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic188896.jpg@2.3791@300@2@2
64@Sentinels of the Multiverse@A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse!&#10;&#10;Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.&#10;&#10;Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which &quot;play themselves&quot;, requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KQJVwFggx85c6tkq99MW9Q__original/img/6zbLmCIIUoFlK_l5AnIKB7UGsOg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1296144.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KQJVwFggx85c6tkq99MW9Q__thumb/img/rts0fENMEytS8E6wJjiZ1bpoThk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1296144.jpg@2.5088@60@2@5
65@The Quacks of Quedlinburg@In The Quacks of Quedlinburg, players are charlatans &mdash; or quack doctors &mdash; each making their own secret brew by adding ingredients one at a time. Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!&#10;&#10;Each player has their own bag of ingredient chips. During each round, they simultaneously draw chips from their bags and add them to their pots. The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the pot's swirling pattern, increasing how much the potion will be worth. Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot will explode!&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients, depending on how well they managed to fill up their pots. But players whose pots have exploded must choose points or coins &mdash; not both! The player with the most victory points at the end of nine rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pH5LgRL4mNRon-2NsSDb1Q__original/img/8PEJOyuKGbTaEGbUbCoLQy_i65Y=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6137509.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pH5LgRL4mNRon-2NsSDb1Q__thumb/img/E_XspsgbgrVOwOeCuZMO1S8W2rk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6137509.png@1.9424@45@2@4
66@Bohnanza@Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8SADtu_4zBH_UJrCo935Iw__original/img/RNuAr2CDbxE3XzeJVkxj4Df3eVM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6348964.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8SADtu_4zBH_UJrCo935Iw__thumb/img/vwTEQOWA3Mw__ztkTMulOgJ82Pw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6348964.jpg@1.6737@45@2@7
67@Crokinole@Crokinole is a dexterity traditional game.&#10;&#10;Crokinole is played on a circular wooden board, with wooden circular disks as playing pieces.&#10;&#10;Players take turns shooting disks across the circular wooden board by flicking the disks with their fingers.  Players try to land their disks in scoring regions on the board, with the highest scoring area the recessed hole in the very center of the board.  Each round, each player/side alternately shoots a set number of disks (usually 12 or 8), shooting one disk each turn.&#10;&#10;As a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.&#10;&#10;Players must position their disk on the start of each of their turns in their quadrant in front of them, touching the outer scoring ring boundary.&#10;&#10;If there are no opponent's disks on the board, they must aim for the center of the board.&#10;&#10;If there is an opponent's disk on the board, they must aim and hit an opponent's piece first, either directly, or by a carrom shot.&#10;&#10;The center recessed hole is worth 20 points, and disks are removed and scored at the end of the round if they land in the center hole.&#10;&#10;Disks that are outside the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, or are touching the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, are removed from play for the round.&#10;&#10;Scoring is by cancellation scoring (e.g. Player/Side One scores 250, and Player/Side Two scores 225, Player/Side One scores 25.)&#10;&#10;It is usually played as a two-player game or as a four-player game with partners.&#10;&#10;Play is to a set score, usually the first player/side to 100.&#10;&#10;Alternately, play is set at &quot;Match Scoring&quot; where the winner of each round scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A &quot;game&quot; is usually played to four rounds, with the winner of each &quot;game&quot; being the one with the most points. The numbers of &quot;games&quot; in a match is set by the tournament.&#10;&#10;The World Crokinole Championship uses &quot;Match Scoring.&quot;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7ejbxsn-UtLl3ehamuAEdw__original/img/HJOZG6y87_skppfIqX-voRlhNxE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic79413.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7ejbxsn-UtLl3ehamuAEdw__thumb/img/AX0pNTuAzpUfxlvtwirM6zAK4ws=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic79413.jpg@1.2429@30@2@4
68@Breakout: Normandy@&quot;Breakout: Normandy&quot; is a complex two-player wargame on the Allied invasion of France in World War 2.  The game concentrates on the initial landings and the subsequent breakout attempts.  The German player tries to prevent a successful Allied landing, and if that fails, to contain the beachhead.  The Allied player wins by establishing a beachhead, or (better) by successfully breaking out of the landing area.&#10;&#10;The mapboard depicts the Normandy area where the initial landings took place.  Units are regiments and brigades, representing infantry, airborne, armour artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft units.&#10;&#10;The game uses the area-impulse system used in Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino and Turning Point: Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9NYEKmPccsWVxyaOlracbg__original/img/8throOJoHy1FQ56akF1FlbferEk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5069218.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9NYEKmPccsWVxyaOlracbg__thumb/img/jDQR_NX6mmp_3oAm9NAmP3Ldq3Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5069218.jpg@3.3913@240@2@2

70@Magic: The Gathering@&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        GAME SYSTEM&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole. It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker&mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.&#10;&#10;This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.&#10;&#10;Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.&#10;&#10;An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are nearly 20,000 different cards from which to build your deck!&#10;&#10;Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.&#10;&#10;Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called &quot;the stack,&quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.&#10;&#10;Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CxJmNl4wR4InjqyNrMdBTw__original/img/TKQgvl_i6zVYld8Gac8oU-c2ezE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic163749.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CxJmNl4wR4InjqyNrMdBTw__thumb/img/TtlQgYxLTPyYQWJvruMHfwKPReE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic163749.jpg@3.2379@20@2@2
71@Eldritch Horror@Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__original/img/vxK08kQAEn5qPbejK2CUTyWOsig=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1872452.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__thumb/img/I1oCwOcGxAOVx2VE2LcXuKWoLvY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1872452.jpg@3.3236@240@1@8
72@Secret Hitler@Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930s Germany. Each player is randomly and secretly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader; the liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. The liberal team always has a majority.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is.&#10;&#10;Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.&#10;&#10;The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rAQ3hIXoH6xDcj41v9iqCg__original/img/7oKwNUYakx3-vHUBLHWVuFNKfl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5164305.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rAQ3hIXoH6xDcj41v9iqCg__thumb/img/xA2T7PiwN3Z8pwAksicoCOA1tf0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5164305.jpg@1.677@45@5@10
73@The Voyages of Marco Polo@In 1271, 17-year-old Marco Polo started on a journey to China with his father and older brother. After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.&#10;&#10;In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. Each action requires the use of one or more dice, and can be collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts or traveling on the board. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having trading posts in the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n1G7_aWToLAAB7Mqt8iwyA__original/img/VQddnfi_QO0r4GmUU3M8_-nuO3Q=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2461346.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n1G7_aWToLAAB7Mqt8iwyA__thumb/img/qfEgrXBN5L1EeMQ91siw6r_OoL4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2461346.png@3.189@100@2@4
74@The 7th Continent@It's the early 20th century. You have decided to sail back to the newly discovered seventh continent to attempt to lift the terrible curse that has struck you since your return from the previous expedition.&#10;&#10;In The 7th Continent, a solo or cooperative &quot;choose-your-own-adventure&quot; exploration board game, you choose a character and begin your adventure on your own or with a team of other explorers. Inspired by the Fighting Fantasy book series, you will discover the extent of this wild new land through a variety of terrain and event cards. In a land fraught with danger and wonders, you have to use every ounce of wit and cunning to survive, crafting tools, weapons, and shelter to ensure your survival.&#10;&#10;Unlike most board games, it will take you many, MANY hours of exploring and searching the seventh continent until you eventually discover how to remove the curse(s)...or die trying.&#10;&#10;The 7th Continent features an easy saving system so that you can stop playing at any time and resume your adventure later on, just like in a video game!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OYne8uBCHv5oEgRfpOrV0A__original/img/jcTlhpYG2496xQtuQ277bFTIldY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2648303.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OYne8uBCHv5oEgRfpOrV0A__thumb/img/_YPdmxegKIoZI_ButuMJzfw9UBo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2648303.jpg@2.9024@1000@1@4

This, in turn, will enable you to deliver the goods from your factories to cities with high demand &mdash; but be sure to earmark goods for fulfilling profitable public contracts because when the connection to Trieste is made, your net worth is all that matters.&#10;&#10;Imperial Steam is a highly strategic yet accessible economic and logistics game that sees you making difficult decisions as you manage your business's operations while navigating fierce competition to ensure your victory!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/detq5U6nwb3WDd8ecKex_A__original/img/xiKG0vlm8yAd2EblILmPZovE0X8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6277816.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/detq5U6nwb3WDd8ecKex_A__thumb/img/jgeeNLOzAPgJSx5q8ZC2EBApkTg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6277816.jpg@4.1273@120@2@4
76@Nanty Narking@Immersed deeply in the world of Dickens&rsquo;s and Doyle&rsquo;s literature, Nanty Narking moves you into the realities of the myths and legends of the Victorian era. The events in the game are tied to real and fictional characters and places in Victorian London The same London which inspired so many stories&hellip;&#10;&#10;The action takes place on the city map, with players placing their agents and buildings on the board through card play. Every card is unique. The cards bring the game to life as they include most of the famous characters who have appeared in the various books. The rules are relatively simple: Play a card and do what it says. Most cards have more than one action on them, and you can choose to do some or all of these actions. Some cards also allow you to play a second card, so you can chain actions.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player draws a secret personality with specific victory conditions, which means that you can never be sure what the other players need to do in order to win. You need to fulfill your goal while also trying to prevent others from winning!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QVnxAPBc7rhzQ90WGH-G_Q__original/img/cH6iypKk34JkDjEHGj6laKJ-GeI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6111342.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QVnxAPBc7rhzQ90WGH-G_Q__thumb/img/rB0pRXnEr4Kw6EUUOZH35f5uUiI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6111342.png@2.2558@60@2@4
77@Architects of the West Kingdom@Architects of the West Kingdom is set at the end of the Carolingian Empire, circa 850 AD. As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. Players need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times, and rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?&#10;&#10;The aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing various buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's cathedral. Throughout the game, players need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhanded deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends once a set number of constructions have been completed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OAX7HfOz-9N60StgADzd0g__original/img/x2Y_DYWrzzleMETfnu7Jm3R8jPo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3781944.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OAX7HfOz-9N60StgADzd0g__thumb/img/sBMaoJ-Kz74lJ6djcl-NNMTr0Wo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3781944.png@2.7546@80@1@5
78@Monopoly@Theme&#10;Players take the part of land owners, attempting to buy and then develop their land. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&#10;&#10;Cultural impact on rules&#10;Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take &quot;loans&quot; from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.&#10;&#10;Background&#10;In the USA in 1933, Charles Darrow devised Monopoly based on an earlier game by Elizabeth J. Magie. The patent was filed 31st August 1935 while the game was on sale in America. Based on an earlier game, The Landlord's Game, it was at first rejected by Parker Bros., as being too complicated to be a success. How wrong could they be! It came to the UK in 1936, made under licence by Waddingtons. Darrow died in 1967 having realised he had developed one of the most successful board games of all times. It was awarded as Game of the Century by the TRA (Toy Retailers Association).&#10;&#10;Monopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show the evils of earning money from renting land (as it leads to the destitution of all but one player) and the virtues of the proposed Single Tax - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate &quot;Single Tax&quot; rules.&#10;&#10;The game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow, who introduced it to the world in its current form.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    The Landlord's Game&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;Official&#10;&#10;    Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on&#10;    Monopoly Free Parking Mini Game&#10;    Monopoly Get Out of Jail Mini Game&#10;&#10;&#10;Unofficial&#10;&#10;    Super Add-Ons: Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)&#10;    Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)&#10;    Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion (fan expansion for Monopoly)&#10;    Mafiopoly&#10;    Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck&#10;    Final Fantasy Monopoly&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9nGoBZ0MRbi6rdH47sj2Qg__original/img/bA8irydTCNlE38QSzM9EhcUIuNU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5786795.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9nGoBZ0MRbi6rdH47sj2Qg__thumb/img/ezXcyEsHhS9iRxmuGe8SmiLLXlM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5786795.jpg@1.6323@180@2@8

80@Pax Pamir: Second Edition@In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.&#10;&#10;In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.&#10;&#10;To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.&#10;&#10;After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__original/img/7DlaMCmuoJzm9AzelmStYIDgutI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4503733.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__thumb/img/NyoufH5YBFCh1rKy4uy76bR4ITk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4503733.png@3.834@120@1@5
81@Mage Wars Arena@What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?&#10;&#10;Mage Wars &mdash; redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy &mdash; pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts &ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!&#10;&#10;Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called &quot;zones&quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.&#10;&#10;Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells &ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments &ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.&#10;&#10;Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.&#10;    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.&#10;    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.&#10;    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.&#10;&#10;&#10;The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.&#10;&#10;New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game. The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!&#10;&#10;Extra copies of spells available with:&#10;&#10;    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1&#10;    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WxajTXKxDza3UvwNMs-PUA__original/img/CwO1kHL2K_nTuRsBKwGyHHWWutk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2386027.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WxajTXKxDza3UvwNMs-PUA__thumb/img/ZHMk4Aqu_VTgP9IFwY5QriZL6W8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2386027.jpg@3.6805@90@2@2
82@Hansa Teutonica@The players act as traders trying to get victory points for building a network of offices, controlling cities, collecting bonus markers, or when other traders use the cities they control. After controlling a line between two cities with your pawns, you can decide to build an office (and maybe also establish control and/or get a bonus marker) or to get a skill improvement from some of the cities.&#10;&#10;Players have to improve their traders' &quot;skills&quot; for the following effects: getting more VP from offices in their network, getting more available action points, increasing the number of available pawns, and getting the right to place pawns and get more special pawns.&#10;&#10;This game appeared originally as Wettstreit der H&auml;ndler at the Hippodice competition.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3IkzYcplGfFtVrd3syClHg__original/img/RqYxJUdNXPmHUWrlADIbTf9Bi_g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic839090.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3IkzYcplGfFtVrd3syClHg__thumb/img/4350nWgj6kTrn8BWFI6cxvts_E0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic839090.jpg@3.1057@90@2@5
83@Rococo@Welcome to the Rococo era during the reign of Louis XV when it&rsquo;s safe to say that holding lavish balls is quite trendy. Important personalities wrap up in noble coats and dresses, anxious to outshine one another. As the biggest event is coming up in just a few weeks, everyone is turning to you with their requests: an elegant coat here, a stunning dress there, or a donation to fund the fireworks at the event. Soon you realize that it&rsquo;s not just about your dressmaking business anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s about managing the most prestigious ball of the era&hellip;and now it&rsquo;s time to roc(k)!&#10;&#10;Rococo is a Eurostyle board game with an interesting take on deck-building. Each turn you play one of your employee cards and let that employee perform a task: hire a new employee, buy resources, manufacture a coat or dress, or invest in the ball&rsquo;s decorations. But not every employee is up to every task, so you must choose and lead your employees wisely &mdash; especially since each employee grants a unique bonus and some of these bonuses generate prestige points.&#10;&#10;After seven rounds, the game ends with the big ball and a final scoring. Then you gain prestige points for certain employee bonuses and for coats and dresses that you rent out to guests at the ball as well as for decorations that you funded. The player who collected the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Go8mEe3K1VjYFJxLXEUPqQ__original/img/RcJ7xX5K_y0G87nK5ttdcWeb10U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1795272.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Go8mEe3K1VjYFJxLXEUPqQ__thumb/img/cclTiR7tkCqMj-TuFAaYfySFmH4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1795272.jpg@3.0851@120@2@5
84@Cascadia@Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.&#10;&#10;In the game, you take turns building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife. You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available &mdash; unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.&#10;&#10;Ideally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game's end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player's. At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife. Maybe hawks want to be separate from other hawks, while foxes want lots of different animals surrounding them and bears want to be in pairs.

Move your Olaf token through all kinds of trouble to be the last player without a fully melted Olaf!&#10;&#10;A Frozen themed reimplementation of the Milton Bradley game Ice Cube, players move ice cube-based Olaf tokens around the board trying not to melt while trying to hasten the melting of their opponents through the use of water, salt and other means.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v65Y12A986IWqxy7cIaNmQ__original/img/HECimtbLPD36l60cwZewXcz982k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6689690.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v65Y12A986IWqxy7cIaNmQ__thumb/img/rZSMD-y_8IByxRtzmPcBpsWiAWc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6689690.jpg@0@20@2@4
86@Alhambra@Granada, 1278. At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.&#10;&#10;The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.&#10;&#10;In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.&#10;&#10;The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.&#10;&#10;Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OiqKsYDh7pqeRYKG__kMSw__original/img/Oe2ZTGE2hUnyZQIEoIjM_zwYfcY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4893652.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OiqKsYDh7pqeRYKG__kMSw__thumb/img/Pj2FP8bV-BHofcDS0eGLh8gzTmI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4893652.jpg@2.1023@60@2@6
87@Glen More II: Chronicles@Glen More II: Chronicles is a sequel to Glen More, expanding the gameplay substantially compared to the original game.&#10;&#10;In Glen More II: Chronicles, each player represents the leader of a Scottish clan from the early medieval ages until the 19th century, a leader looking to expand their territory and wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.&#10;&#10;Improvements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Chronicles&quot; in the title &mdash; a set of eight expansions to the base game &mdash; are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The &quot;Highland Boat Race&quot; Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot; Chronicle adds a neutral &quot;Englishman&quot; playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn &mdash; if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a &quot;monster game&quot;.&#10;&#10;Another major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new &quot;person&quot; tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMRuph3HFUcaSpJZihGZKw__original/img/ehoqoTirtFb5p9Wk2SwWV8nr6ZU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5841874.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMRuph3HFUcaSpJZihGZKw__thumb/img/UHuDcnjAwCiXbNfjuY26-EEnG2M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5841874.jpg@3.0348@120@2@4
88@Babylonia@The Neo-Babylonian empire, especially under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 B.C.), was a period of rebirth for southern Mesopotamia. Irrigation systems improved and expanded, increasing agricultural production. Urban life flourished with the creation of new cities, monuments and temples, and the consequent increase in trade.&#10;&#10;In Babylonia, you try to make your clan prosper under the peace and imperial power of that era. You have to place your nobles, priests, and craftsmen tokens on the map to make your relations with the cities as profitable as possible. Properly placing these counters next to the court also allows you to gain the special power of some rulers. Finally, the good use of your peasants in the fertile areas gives more value to your crops. The player who gets the most points through all these actions wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XKdSpV2ZTdOEd0NXy3Ig1Q__original/img/Q4u1KwykZGb21eEf0-QLwPx-DQ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4657338.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XKdSpV2ZTdOEd0NXy3Ig1Q__thumb/img/Gvkzb72NQtK-Poor3FJXfj-L8RU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4657338.jpg@2.4098@60@2@4
89@PARKS@PARKS is a celebration of the US National Parks featuring illustrious art from Fifty-Nine Parks.&#10;&#10;In PARKS, players will take on the role of two hikers as they trek through different trails across four seasons of the year. While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the places your hikers visit. These memories are represented by various resource tokens like mountains and forests. Collecting these memories in sets will allow players to trade them in to visit a National Park at the end of each hike.&#10;&#10;Each trail represents one season of the year, and each season, the trails will change and grow steadily longer. The trails, represented by tiles, get shuffled in between each season and laid out anew for the next round. Resources can be tough to come by especially when someone is at the place you&rsquo;re trying to reach! Campfires allow you to share a space and time with other hikers. Canteens and Gear can also be used to improve your access to resources through the game. It&rsquo;ll be tough to manage building up your engine versus spending resources on parks, but we bet you&rsquo;re up to the challenge.

90@Anachrony@It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.&#10;&#10;By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...&#10;&#10;Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs &mdash; unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__original/img/3KfMPSj7jjhG0g5lQBsO-bn67D0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3499707.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__thumb/img/a0G93aMOKp3_mmnCURYWuZd210U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499707.jpg@4.013@120@1@4

92@Castles of Mad King Ludwig@In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever &mdash; subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.&#10;&#10;After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King's demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xkOTIpxwGQN4iyvbeqnytQ__original/img/lIBr9tLz2yMll_kmeAQGeLDYu0M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1961827.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xkOTIpxwGQN4iyvbeqnytQ__thumb/img/kSSz-CQGEZPyiGzAKQCvSDsepRo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1961827.jpg@2.6555@90@1@4

95@Russian Railroads@In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.&#10;&#10;The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&#10;&#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&#10;- earn 2 coins&#10;- take 2 temporary workers&#10;- jump ahead in turn order&#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&#10;&#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0oEVgeqs4_rT8oyb1_Juw__original/img/EnBmUkDKSbcBusI6nVRczadYs0M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1772936.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0oEVgeqs4_rT8oyb1_Juw__thumb/img/oZkHYUMtcGVwg_gz6OjtuiD3vmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1772936.jpg@3.4098@120@2@4
96@Downforce@High-stakes bidding on million-dollar race cars. Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.&#10;&#10;Downforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.&#10;&#10;This is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play. Special attention was paid to the colors, the layout of the cards, the design of the cars, the details on the board, and more.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c74C-NVJHuMVxt6A_j2TsA__original/img/FHgW4u5dIooEJnNjm2RXcO_yJWs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3432548.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c74C-NVJHuMVxt6A_j2TsA__thumb/img/OUdT3uFyqBBzN7q9ZDFN6WBiecU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3432548.png@1.7376@40@2@6
97@Dominion: Intrigue@In Dominion: Intrigue (as with Dominion), each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box: &quot;Something&rsquo;s afoot. The steward smiles at you like he has a secret, or like he thinks you have a secret, or like you think he thinks you have a secret. There are secret plots brewing, you&rsquo;re sure of it. At the very least, there are yours. A passing servant murmurs, &ldquo;The eggs are on the plate.&rdquo; You frantically search your codebook for the translation before realizing he means that breakfast is ready. Excellent. Everything is going according to plan.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dominion: Intrigue adds rules for playing with up to 8 players at two tables or for playing a single game with up to 6 players when combined with Dominion.

In this game, the players are powerful lords vying for control of this great city. Its treasures and resources are ripe for the taking, and that which cannot be gained through trickery and negotiation must be taken by force!&#10;&#10;In Lords of Waterdeep, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder &ndash; or help &ndash; the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans.&#10;&#10;During the course of play, you may gain points or resources through completing quests, constructing buildings, playing intrigue cards or having other players utilize the buildings you have constructed.

99@Feudum@Blimey! You and your blokes have been banished and stripped of everything but a few shillings and table scraps. Undaunted, you journey to a strange land to reinvent yourself and reclaim your honor. Will you farm the earth, fight as knights or finagle your own feudums?&#10;&#10;Feudum (latin for fiefdom) is an economic medieval game of hand and resource management for 2-5 players. With many strategies at their disposal, players optimize four actions per turn in attempt to score the most victory points over five epochs.&#10;&#10;Each player controls several medieval characters that roam the countryside tending farms, taxing towns and taking outposts in effort to rise in power.&#10;&#10;But that&rsquo;s only the tip of the behemoth's horn! You will also compete to acquire coveted feudums, which increase your membership status in one of six guilds. But beware! Feudum owners must pay homage to the king through military service or face the charge of disloyalty.&#10;&#10;Once a guild member, you will dutifully play your part in a progressive economic cycle, whereby the farmer ships goods to the merchant who equips the alchemist, who invents black powder, which arms the knight, and so on.&#10;&#10;If you run your guilds wisely, maintain control of key locations and adapt best to changing events, you will be victorious. Unless, of course, you starve, get sidetracked by sea serpents or develop an unhealthy interest in fermented grapes.

101@Dune@Imagine you can control the forces of a noble family, guild, or religious order on a barren planet which is the only source for the most valuable substance in the known universe.&#10;&#10;Imagine you can rewrite the script for one of the most famous science fiction books of all time. Welcome to the acclaimed 40-year-old board game which allows you to recreate the incredible world of Frank Herbert&rsquo;s DUNE.&#10;&#10;In DUNE you will become the leader of one of six great factions. Each wishes to control the most valuable resource in the universe - melange, the mysterious spice only found at great cost on the planet DUNE. As Duke Leto Atreides says &ldquo;All fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.&rdquo; And without melange space travel would be impossible. Only by ingesting the addictive drug can the Guild Steersman continue to experience visions of the future, enabling them to plot a safe path through hyperspace.&#10;&#10;Who will control DUNE?

102@Medici@Another Reiner Knizia standby, this game plays very well with varying numbers of people.  The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total &quot;cargo load&quot;.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.&#10;&#10; Related Games: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)&#10;     Strozzi&#10;     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1njrltRuw3DrS0gNNu02Dg__original/img/DcY7lagZO1XKuTQY5Tfk8Hwm0B8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2672797.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1njrltRuw3DrS0gNNu02Dg__thumb/img/FUuOaqHk3ohszzJvf8EcN7dphus=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2672797.jpg@2.2525@60@2@6
103@The Estates@The City Council recently approved the zoning map for a new urban development &mdash; The Estates &mdash; featuring high-end infrastructure and a modern atmosphere for its citizens. Soon after, the banks awarded millions of dollars in loans to six real estate investment firms to help develop this new area. The zoning map for The Estates calls for two rows of four buildings each, located between the River and Main Street. The meadows on the other side of the River are to remain a recreational area for the City.&#10;&#10;But, with hopes of larger profits, investors and building tycoons entirely ignore the City Council's demands and begin developing three rows of buildings instead. The Mayor catches wind of the potential for profit and begins planning a new mansion in The Estates, which would double the value of one of the building rows! With some sketchy building permits, investors begin developing buildings on the other side of the River, beyond the designated building zone. However, the City Council takes rigorous steps to put an end to the racketeering with an ultimatum: As soon as the first two rows are completed, the buildings in the uncompleted row will be torn down, resulting in a huge loss for all who invested there. At the end of the day, the investor with the highest-valued buildings will come out on top.&#10;&#10;The players take on the role of investors seeking to make the most money by developing buildings in The Estates. Players will bid for the various building pieces and place them in The Estates to their benefit. All buildings in completed rows score positive points, while all buildings in incomplete rows score negative points. It is possible to have zero completed rows of buildings.&#10;&#10;A game of The Estates lasts around 40 minutes and can be played in several rounds to experience a shifting economy.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AvC3AzHo8JlcvgKtQ3PDWA__original/img/bLkTdJ11F1JN8zUU4dPjR0J3_2k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4071903.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AvC3AzHo8JlcvgKtQ3PDWA__thumb/img/eMsTjGHKNFzWiw7uNiOKDLtYcq4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4071903.jpg@2.3273@60@2@5
104@Caylus@Once upon a time ...&#10;1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.&#10;&#10;The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.&#10;&#10;As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yC7nOSc1x5PT-oNnh6TEcQ__original/img/ugJgRdFpYSsb5Pj1NDk76q6LKTo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1638795.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yC7nOSc1x5PT-oNnh6TEcQ__thumb/img/ec9AK_e7FTbxy9tA8er2wW4UnqA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1638795.jpg@3.8005@150@2@5
105@The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game@The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with up to three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.&#10;&#10;The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.&#10;&#10;Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, typical scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.&#10;&#10;The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit books. These saga-quests can optionally be played together as a Campaign Mode, with lasting consequences arising from the players' actions and decisions.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZmXi5BbtoWl58ZnKcUy1vw__original/img/nNHf1qRJCVQx_0p-1zM8QKxcywo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic906495.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZmXi5BbtoWl58ZnKcUy1vw__thumb/img/__NGanznvqHKTFhj28S8ZpfLbpc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic906495.jpg@3.1954@60@1@2

108@Ra@Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

109@Space Empires 4X@Space Empires is a game in the finest tradition of 4X space games - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.  Each player builds up a space empire and uses it to conquer the other players.  Exploration on the mounted map is simple for players (and dangerous for their ships), revealing different space terrain that affects movement and combat.&#10;&#10;Space Empires was developed to keep a rich theme without overcomplicated rules.  The game includes carriers and fighters, mines, cloaking, a very large technology tree, fifteen ship classes, merchant shipping, colonization, mining, terraforming, bases, shipyards, black holes, warp points, and non-player aliens.  Yet the rules are short and intuitive:  The basic rules are 8 pages long and increase to 11 pages in length when the advanced rules are included.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tMPL9ySUdJvhMc8qhIvHdQ__original/img/naqrOuPy757n2OFQ0sYJy9e98Pk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6439163.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tMPL9ySUdJvhMc8qhIvHdQ__thumb/img/dR67zPkJMkELpt7KEzjlMIDR4NA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6439163.jpg@3.3867@180@1@4
110@A War of Whispers@A War of Whispers is a competitive board game for 2 to 4 players. Five mighty empires are at war for the world, but you are no mighty ruler. Instead, you play a secret society that is betting on the results of this war while pulling strings to rig the results and ensure their bets pay off. A War of Whispers is a game of deep strategy, hidden agendas, and shifting loyalties.&#10;&#10;You start the game with five loyalty tokens, each corresponding to one of the five different empires, bet randomly on a loyalty value. Your primary goal is to ensure that when the game ends, the empires you are most loyal to control the most cities across the globe. Gameplay consists of turns broken down into four phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Deploy agents phase: In player order (starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise), each player removes, then deploys agents to empire councils, the positions on the board marked Sheriff, Steward, Marshall, and Chancellor.&#10;    Empire turns phase: Each council position on each empire council will take an action. If a player has acquired cards, they may play them during this phase.&#10;    Cleanup phase: Add the turn marker to the next space on the turn tracker, then each player discards down to the hand limit of five cards.&#10;    Swap phase: In player order, each player may swap two of their unrevealed loyalty tokens. If you choose to do so, you must reveal both of the swapped loyalty tokens. They remain revealed for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay repeats itself in this order four times. When the last space on the turn track is filled, the game ends immediately and scoring commences. The player with the most points based off their empire loyalties and the cities they control wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/D3Fl15xiRd0QtghO0ZBiRA__original/img/c88Nn0ANeyrOF6cGvmKYazDtVSw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4150994.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/D3Fl15xiRd0QtghO0ZBiRA__thumb/img/6HGGwpXvSqqHCUiDZxf-33V8i7Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4150994.jpg@2.5753@60@2@4

As heads of influential families, players strive to come to power with cunning and malice, power and strength, virtue and infamy. Their goal: the king's throne!&#10;&#10;In this tactical card game, hidden cards are played in turn.

112@Beyond the Sun@Beyond the Sun is a space civilization game in which players collectively decide the technological progress of humankind at the dawn of the Spacefaring Era, while competing against each other to be the leading faction in economic development, science, and galactic influence.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a variable number of rounds until a number of game-end achievements are collectively claimed by the players. The winner is the faction with the most victory points, which are obtained by researching technologies, improving their economy, controlling and colonizing systems, and completing various achievements and events throughout the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player moves their action pawn to an empty action space, then takes that action. They then conduct their production phase, either producing ore, growing their population, or trading one of those resources for another. Finally, they can claim up to one achievement, if possible.&#10;&#10;As players take actions, they research new technologies that come in four levels. Each technology is one of four types (scientific, economic, military, commercial), and higher-level technologies must match one of the types of tech that lead into it. Thus, players create their own technology tree in each game, using these actions to increase their military strength, to jump to different habitable exoplanetary systems, to colonize those systems, to boost their resource production, to develop android tech that allows growth without population, and more.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BfEHqHQAvZLbRX7y7e9TWg__original/img/h2NEwLqn5mNkcEfMdP_8oMWa9KE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5617866.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BfEHqHQAvZLbRX7y7e9TWg__thumb/img/6rZLxebQyTXasbAPddxpdE1LVls=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5617866.jpg@3.0956@120@2@4

The jungle ecosystem is full of symbiosis and mutualism, and players must grow tall trees and lush jungle plants to attract the most diverse wildlife. By carefully selecting what grows in your forest, you can create the ideal balance of flora and fauna and develop a thriving rainforest.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns selecting new cards for their forest from three growth piles. Each time you look at a pile, you may select it and add those cards to your rainforest tableau, or return the pile face down, adding one additional card to it. As the piles grow, you must search for the plants and animals that will benefit your forest the most &mdash; but choose carefully as the jungle also contains dangers in the form or fire, disease, and drought.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-zWPMAXd1IZllCMAP5IeVA__original/img/vk0v34dLBl4utcZV-Kqc3QXVIUo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5090694.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-zWPMAXd1IZllCMAP5IeVA__thumb/img/qkimPPOS3fMxvXDtXZvPemc-Lvc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5090694.jpg@2.0566@30@1@4
114@Unmatched: Battle of Legends, Volume One@In battle, there are no equals.&#10;&#10;Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.&#10;&#10;Battle of Legends, Volume One features four heroes. King Arthur sacrifices cards to power up his attacks and gets some timely assistance from Merlin's magic. Alice is back from Wonderland with a giant vorpal blade and the Jabberwock by her side as she grows and shrinks to gain advantages on attack and defense. Medusa is happy to attack from range and let her harpies hound you, but just one devastating glance could end the battle quickly. Sinbad grows in power as he gains experience on each of his voyages.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannh&auml;user for ranged attacks and area effects.&#10;&#10;The game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4AlLbprNustr9G7pbkGRuw__original/img/d7Z89SEv9T_HqPaYEomeKcFmgeA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4621579.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4AlLbprNustr9G7pbkGRuw__thumb/img/nVkIL7RgCkFpBuxbJ3BfOxIJscU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4621579.jpg@1.9194@40@2@4
115@Millennium Blades@Millennium Blades is a CCG-Simulator -- A game in which you play as a group of friends who play the fictional CCG &quot;Millennium Blades&quot;.&#10;&#10;In this game you will build decks, play the meta, acquire valuable collections, crack open random boosters, and compete in tournaments for prizes and fame. The game takes you from Starter Deck to Regionals in about 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;Multiple games can also be chained together to form a Campaign, going from Regionals to Nationals in game 2 and from Nationals to Worlds in game 3, with each game introducing ever more powerful cards and higher stakes, but also resetting the power of the game so that each player has a fair chance to win each 'season' of the campaign.&#10;&#10;The game draws heavily on Manga/Anime inspiration for its art, and parodies Magic: the Gathering, Yugioh, and many other collectible games.&#10;&#10;At its heart, it&rsquo;s a commodity trading game, except that instead of cubes or stocks, the things you&rsquo;ll be buying, selling, and speculating on are trading cards that can be used throughout the game in periodic tournaments. By trading wisely, playing the market, working together with friends, building collections, and winning tournaments, you&rsquo;ll secure points and become the Millennium Blades World Champion.&#10;&#10;The game features a system of card pods, where you will play with about 400 of the base game&rsquo;s 600 cards every game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fqNRfH1NRnnhiIJisZjEoQ__original/img/8dQbVNL60rGtZX71LU1yocQD9Ro=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2468179.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fqNRfH1NRnnhiIJisZjEoQ__thumb/img/88CPRQuwAZN7TCr9UYNKkLT3SGQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2468179.jpg@3.6855@120@2@5
116@Space Alert@Space Alert is a cooperative team survival game. Players become crew members of a small spaceship scanning dangerous sectors of the galaxy. The missions last just 10 real-time minutes (hyperspace jump, sector scan, hyperspace jump back) and the only task the players have is to protect their ship.&#10;&#10;During play, the central computer will announce the presence of various threats on one the supplied 10 minute soundtracks that also acts as a game timer. The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.&#10;&#10;The game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation.&#10;&#10;(Based on a description from Czech Games Edition)&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__original/img/ccy5tGJK7WF9B6ykayJEm5cReTM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic384313.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__thumb/img/9tewdwxUKcqikj0QlVSUmwRPK68=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic384313.jpg@2.9663@30@1@5
117@Imperial Struggle@In 1697 the Sun King, Louis XIV, emerged from a decade of war with his Continental ambitions still unsatisfied. Meanwhile, King William III of England sat easier on his new throne than he ever had before. With the Spanish succession crisis unresolved and looming, there were no illusions that the new century would be a quiet one. But neither France nor England could have anticipated the tumult of the years to come: a Second Hundred Years' War, during which these two tenacious adversaries would compete fiercely and proudly along every axis of human achievement. On battlefields from India to Canada to the Caribbean Sea their armies and fleets would clash; in the salons of Paris and the coffee-houses of London the modern world&rsquo;s politics and economics would be born; and finally a revolution would rock the foundations of society &ndash; a revolution that could have ended not in blood and terror but in a triumph of democracy and liberty that might have transformed the world beyond imagining.&#10;&#10;Imperial Struggle is a two-player game depicting the 18th-century rivalry between France and Britain. It begins in 1697, as the two realms wait warily for the King of Spain to name an heir, and ends in 1789, when a new order brought down the Bastille. The game is not merely about war: both France and Britain must build the foundations of colonial wealth, deal with the other nations of Europe, and compete for glory across the span of human endeavor.&#10;&#10;Imperial Struggle covers almost 100 years of history and four major wars. Yet it remains a low-complexity game, playable in a short evening. It aims to honor its spiritual ancestor, Twilight Struggle, by pushing further in the direction of simple rules and playable systems, while maintaining global scope and historical sweep in the scope of a single evening. In peace turns, players build their economic interests and alliances, and take advantage of historical events represented by Event cards. They must choose their investments wisely, but also with an eye to denying these opportunities to their opponent. In war turns, each theater can bring great rewards of conquest and prestige, but territorial gains can disappear at the treaty table. At the end of the century, will the British rule an empire on which the sun never sets? Or will France light the way for the world, as the superpower of the Sun King's dreams or the republic of Lafayette's?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FTE7dxVd4jQaIwwRcCQcRw__original/img/u10ruUkKuaXP9f2ZAswX9R9r9hM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5291148.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FTE7dxVd4jQaIwwRcCQcRw__thumb/img/ydG55mHxOdtN5RFN9B9z7qAgLBI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5291148.jpg@3.9699@240@2@2
118@Canvas@In Canvas, you play as a painter competing in an art competition. Players will collect art cards, layering 3 of them together to create their own unique Painting. Each card contains a piece of artwork as well as a set of icons used during scoring. Icons will be revealed or hidden based on the way players choose to layer the cards making for an exciting puzzle. Paintings are scored based on a set of Scoring cards which will change each game. Once players have created and scored 3 paintings the game ends.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may take an Art card or make a painting. Art cards are selected from a row of cards in the center of play. Each of these cards has a cost associated with their position. After selecting an Art card you must pay its cost by placing an Inspiration token on each of the cards to its left. If you do not have enough Inspiration tokens, you may not select that card. Any tokens on the card you have selected are kept for future turns. The far left card costs no Inspiration tokens to take.&#10;&#10;If you have three or more Art cards you may choose to make a painting. Select 3 of your art cards, arrange them in any order and then score them by comparing the visible icons on your painting to the Scoring conditions.&#10;&#10;Once all players have made 3 paintings the game ends.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kXJLvPqcDF7Id5KRejhnuQ__original/img/jiORb05QSdRMi-eo1Vi_3wjUSWU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7125372.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kXJLvPqcDF7Id5KRejhnuQ__thumb/img/5kQGDC3kYmvil7dU8uT-o0sZiEo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7125372.jpg@1.672@30@1@5
119@Skull@Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OPrd2iXm43dir7BwKAMOuQ__original/img/ygPnbmg8FCpA7jO5gXw38uyNQ10=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6097488.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OPrd2iXm43dir7BwKAMOuQ__thumb/img/yEnb4YWN-Cp41KWTQ2EeNkrqlZI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6097488.jpg@1.1247@45@3@6

Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win victory points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory.&#10;&#10;The fiercest player will occupy Tokyo, and earn extra victory points, but that player can't heal and must face all the other monsters alone!&#10;&#10;Top this off with special cards purchased with energy that have a permanent or temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and it's one of the most explosive games of the year!&#10;&#10;In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 victory points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended.&#10;&#10;First Game in the King of Tokyo series&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_RzXpHURC0_xLkvRSR_sw__original/img/hSvWgiRYJCTTuoLOWTW3c8sYtl8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3043734.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_RzXpHURC0_xLkvRSR_sw__thumb/img/OfgWmkGJj5BgOO0zFHEtP5CHfbU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3043734.jpg@1.4887@30@2@6
121@For Sale@For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate. During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.&#10;&#10;The original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30.&#10; The &#195;&#156;berplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players.&#10;&#10;The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the &Uuml;berplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the &Uuml;berplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the &Uuml;berplay edition).&#10;&#10;Rounding rule&#10;&#10;The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.

The possibilities are darn near endless.&#10;&#10;Each player's turn starts with drawing poker cards and/or gaining cash. Then they choose three actions. Possible actions include: move on the map (how far depends on whether they have a mount), doing a location-specific action (such as mine for gold if they are at a gold mine, gamble if they're in a saloon, etc.), fight other players at the same location (either duel them, rob them, or arrest them if they're wanted), play poker cards that have action abilities, etc. Legendary Points (LPs) are earned based on the outcomes of many of these actions, and the winner is whoever has the most LPs at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Key Points&#10;- Award-winning gaming experience set in the American West!&#10;- Beautiful artwork, and presentation brings this highly thematic game to life.&#10;- Intuitive gameplay and choices lets you write your own legend every game!&#10;&#10;Note: The Russian edition of Western Legends contains two expansions packaged inside the box and thus has its own entry here: &#208;&#155;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#139; &#208;&#180;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#183;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#176;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lZwgk3_MqyAmROjkz4v8Wg__original/img/W0gWMrkx5fEgVp8b2fMc-LfGmz8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6974323.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lZwgk3_MqyAmROjkz4v8Wg__thumb/img/pI0Bnq7hO-Msonh7OJkKiHGnmfI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6974323.png@2.8238@90@2@6

129@The Mind@The Mind is more than just a game. It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.&#10;&#10;You start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!&#10;&#10;For an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down. You don't look at the cards played until the end of a level, losing lives at that time for cards played out of order.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q_JGK291hrhnhiRB0667oA__original/img/8VjZEG278faO9JZwzce3v3EKssI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3979766.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q_JGK291hrhnhiRB0667oA__thumb/img/PUrzEmTo5kOcK5BOb4cbOOcH86I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3979766.png@1.0704@20@2@4
130@Wavelength@Wavelength is a social guessing game in which two teams compete to read each other's minds. Teams take turns rotating a dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum. One of the players on your team &mdash; the Psychic &mdash; knows exactly where the bullseye is, and draws a card with a pair of binaries on it (such as: Job - Career, Rough - Smooth, Fantasy - Sci-Fi, Sad Song - Happy Song, etc). The Psychic must then provide a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries.&#10;&#10;For example, if the card this round is HOT-COLD and the bullseye is slightly to the &quot;cold&quot; side of the centre, the Psychic needs to give a clue somewhere in that region. Perhaps &quot;salad&quot;?&#10;&#10;After the Psychic gives their clue, their team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on that spectrum. The closer to the center of the bullseye the team guess, the more points they score!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z4fbPdmJg_5yphJEvql4ZA__original/img/bP1gM8RC-o5iz20_WazBaBNDHnU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4552862.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z4fbPdmJg_5yphJEvql4ZA__thumb/img/bxLuHVLF-Y06jWRSKA-tuQ3YYcE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4552862.png@1.1189@45@2@12
131@No Thanks!@No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple.  Each turn, players have two options:&#10;&#10;    play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card&#10;    pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card&#10;&#10;&#10;However, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game.  The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value.  Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.  Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.&#10;&#10;The first versions of the game supported up to five players, but a 2011 edition supports up to seven.&#10;&#10;This game was originally published in Germany by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!.  Amigo's international edition, titled No Merci! (a delightful multi-lingual pun), had rules in several languages, including English.  The game has subsequently been released in other countries under an assortment of names.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2DyxMVASynw87LRULZuyqA__original/img/IHLuH9f5dB6jJn74cdVdMixAUKg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4657706.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2DyxMVASynw87LRULZuyqA__thumb/img/yIUSMoN8O5FeDZjXa4vreKj5Ogw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4657706.jpg@1.1353@20@3@7
132@Perudo@Liar's Dice, a.k.a. Bluff, Perudo or Dudo, is a South American dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. &quot;there are ten sixes&quot;. However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCiGSoCqbOsXS8JzZZC_SA__original/img/wjGWTdm1oFcxipprcBZT9_OZYRc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3949242.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCiGSoCqbOsXS8JzZZC_SA__thumb/img/g9ex_JOJ3_3fekn4UBwx0iiE6Ik=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3949242.png@1.2612@30@2@6

Unlike other train games you will have to excavate your way up a mountain side, as well as make and lay the track, construct viaducts and stations. All this in competition with the weather of the Welsh mountains (and the game itself)!&#10;&#10;You may be assisted by a train (though that's not always best) and you'll be able to collect essential materials from the Stock Yard. You will obtain special work contracts that give you bonuses.&#10;&#10;Can you contribute more than the other players to the magnificence of the Snowdon Mountain Railway?&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/04SK6RPEqcArT_g8wHH2TA__original/img/NoGoAZPF6DQ_GQoBEXD7rnI2Lvk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1430858.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/04SK6RPEqcArT_g8wHH2TA__thumb/img/9Ih7C267B9XzDU_z5tFHTF94Dh0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1430858.jpg@2.9932@90@1@5
134@Combat Commander: Europe@Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.&#10;&#10;A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.&#10;&#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time.&#10;&#10;Each unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad. Radios &mdash; and individual weapons larger than a pistol, rifle or BAR &mdash; are represented by their own counters.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uKaL10FK-u9wfYyK6MQaNg__original/img/_UDsTX8nCwdsynpoVtzHJHc8h6c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic992459.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uKaL10FK-u9wfYyK6MQaNg__thumb/img/4KyQXL7NMnaXSVYimKkJRCjQ2I8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic992459.jpg@3.2504@180@2@2
135@The Grizzled@The Grizzled is a cooperative game about survival in the trenches during the first World War where players win or lose together.&#10;&#10;Each round, the current team leader will choose how many cards every player draws. Then, going around the table, players must either play a card in their hand or back out of the mission. Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive). At the end of the round, more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as well as their hands without letting time run out.&#10;&#10;If one threat shows up too many times, the team fails the mission. The team must play their threats correctly in order to gain any progress. However, most of the information in a players hand remains secret throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Planning, teamwork, and a little luck are the tools you'll need to win this cooperative game for two to five players.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5JuQCtSAeSZpAL3WgWdwow__original/img/hn5gRpKVlmB3Ds9gIxD7k2SrVt4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3719610.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5JuQCtSAeSZpAL3WgWdwow__thumb/img/XcI-3g0sVumt8DsaMaBGrwftIRw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3719610.png@1.9731@30@2@5
136@Cartographers@Queen Gimnax has ordered the reclamation of the northern lands. As a cartographer in her service, you are sent to map this territory, claiming it for the Kingdom of Nalos. Through official edicts, the queen announces which lands she prizes most, and you will increase your reputation by meeting her demands. But you are not alone in this wilderness. The Dragul contest your claims with their outposts, so you must draw your lines carefully to reduce their influence. Reclaim the greatest share of the queen&rsquo;s desired lands and you will be declared the greatest cartographer in the kingdom.&#10;&#10;In Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale, players compete to earn the most reputation stars by the time four seasons have passed. Each season, players draw on their map sheets and earn reputation by carrying out the queen's edicts before the season is over.

137@Fallout@Fallout is a post-nuclear adventure board game for one to four players. Based on the hit video game series by Bethesda Softworks, each Fallout scenario is inspired by a familiar story from the franchise. Survivors begin the game on the edge of an unexplored landscape, uncertain of what awaits them in this unfamiliar world. With just one objective to guide them from the very beginning, each player must explore the hidden map, fight ferocious enemies, and build the skills of their survivor as they attempt to complete challenging quests and balance feuding factions within the game.&#10;&#10;As they advance their survivors' stories, players come across new quests and individual targets, leading them to gain influence. Who comes out ahead depends on how keenly and aggressively each player ventures through the game; however, if a single faction is pushed to power too quickly, the wasteland will be taken for their own, and the survivors conquered along with it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gjrMWDqLCBb-G0AYbKuSQ__original/img/t5RBBMPvLBa4_vEbK7ZrNbD8IdY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3728149.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gjrMWDqLCBb-G0AYbKuSQ__thumb/img/Idbk30GnVx4RDeZrsUgTXe2RZHs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3728149.jpg@2.9957@180@1@4

Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It's a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror.  Will they Prevail? &#10;&#10;&#10;Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close gates to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many gates open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world - defeat the Ancient One in combat!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9cJf4kd_HZQo6NunfJlo9w__original/img/YA5R2ZUV2Zwt_fgXIxu8bii3OJ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic175966.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9cJf4kd_HZQo6NunfJlo9w__thumb/img/6VzhMMmGOxNTCHQ-8iFdn5vINis=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic175966.jpg@3.5799@240@1@8

All-new dungeon tiles create new challenges and rewards as you explore deeper and deeper in the dungeon. Each quest brings new dungeons as well as new side adventures!&#10;&#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game. Each player starts with a basic deck of cards that they can use to purchase, or upgrade to, other, more powerful cards. Thunderstone Quest brings new play modes to the table. The game will tell a specific story with a series of pre-set dungeon tiles, monsters, heroes and support cards. Each will come with a series of mini-adventures and a story booklet that tells players what happens as they progress through the scenarios.&#10;&#10;Once players have completed the quests they will be able to enjoy great replay value with the available selection of monsters, heroes, and support cards, as well as the new dungeon tiles, by choosing random set-ups before the start of play. Aside from heroes such as wizards, fighters, rogues, and clerics, cards will include supplies that heroes need like weapons, spells, items, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;The dungeon deck is created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different hero types, so players have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iNbiiQKqSfa4Eoq7U-O4Uw__original/img/xOr7JPv4PnikAfJkvfDS3FRUlhM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3941484.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iNbiiQKqSfa4Eoq7U-O4Uw__thumb/img/vpvEr_gA1fMhIgZwafl2oJBR_j4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3941484.jpg@2.8354@90@2@4

142@Pax Renaissance: 2nd Edition@Pax Renaissance 2nd Edition is a game for 1 to 4 players where you play as a banker in Europe at the height of the Renaissance during the late 15th and early 16th-century.&#10;&#10;A time when European nobility and warlords declined and the arts and technology advanced in the wake of a new economic force:  merchants and bankers.  These bankers became the wealthiest private individuals ever as they guided Europe into the modern age.&#10;&#10;As a Renaissance banker, you will finance kings or republics, sponsor voyages of discovery, join secret cabals, or unleash jihads and inquisitions. Your choices determine if Europe is elevated into the bright modern era or remains festering in dark feudalism. Four victories determine the future course of Western Society: will it be towards imperialism, trade globalization, religious totalitarianism, or enlightened art and science?&#10;&#10;New components include punchouts for pirate ships, pawns for concessions and serfs, placards for player boards, and empire squares allowing storage of repressed tokens and queens even if the King is not in a player Tableau.&#10;&#10;Extra game Map Cards are included, allowing the mounted gameboard to be left behind for small game portability. Useful if you have limited space in your game bag.&#10;&#10;Expanded rules include Dalmatians, Cryptography, Condottiere, apostasy, and the solitaire game.

143@Dinosaur Island@In Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species, and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most visitors each season that the park opens.&#10;&#10;Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential visitors, but you'd better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your visitors, and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores, but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to attract visitors to your park the good old-fashioned way?&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hLJv1A1TwrMrLLIJhVpKVA__original/img/LXqkRZSyg3hRMJlUMm2m83gmi_s=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3429338.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hLJv1A1TwrMrLLIJhVpKVA__thumb/img/cHgvJgF-Gr6mgDKj51uPoqbjHQk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3429338.png@3.0384@120@1@4

145@Star Wars: Imperial Assault@Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&#10;&#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&#10;&#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.&#10;&#10;With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault &#226;&#128;&#147; Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pIQ_MXvaoARRp1loCHJuHg__original/img/12Xvbw01hpsAjsO0xrajZt2b5HY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2247647.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pIQ_MXvaoARRp1loCHJuHg__thumb/img/AD5YvNSUaVvITmtQb1-b01VuBbs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2247647.jpg@3.3044@120@1@5
146@Galaxy Trucker@In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&#10;&#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&#10;&#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&#10;&#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&#10;&#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gLFt1Kif5Cfag505_COYYw__original/img/5vUNCkVDoQpcTfmlhFzkS4e1EaQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3926631.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gLFt1Kif5Cfag505_COYYw__thumb/img/WOW_QsRuV1KyP8dLjP0yH6TlpvU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3926631.jpg@2.3299@60@2@4
147@Cribbage@Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.&#10;&#10;The origin date listed for this game is approximate.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UkYLsDGsQ3OdNY_yyYTsuw__original/img/FyqLxmzlD6jaedp9AZKjtBxJf70=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic121094.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UkYLsDGsQ3OdNY_yyYTsuw__thumb/img/bio7Hn5qUp-J19nvJwDFXjViPFc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic121094.jpg@1.9016@30@2@6
148@Mind MGMT: The Psychic Espionage “Game.”@Working from the shadows, Mind MGMT once used its psychically-powered agents to put a stop to global crises. However, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and Mind MGMT is now rotting from the inside. To tighten its iron grip on the world stage, Mind MGMT deploys covert operatives around the world to recruit other psychically-attuned individuals to their side. How can this enigmatic organization, hell bent on global domination, be defeated?&#10;&#10;Thankfully, a few renegade agents have figured out that Mind MGMT has been compromised and have defected, turning their backs on the syndicate. They now use their own psychic abilities to prevent Mind MGMT from achieving its nefarious goals.&#10;&#10;In Mind MGMT: The Psychic Espionage &quot;Game.&quot;, one player controls Mind MGMT and must scour the city for new recruits. They move around on a secret map, trying to visit locations that match one of their three randomly drawn feature cards. They can also use their four Immortals to protect locations from being exposed.&#10;&#10;All other players control the rogue agents who must try to stop Mind MGMT before it's too late!

149@Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar@Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker placement. Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located &quot;later&quot; on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you &ndash; but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear. There are many paths to victory. Pleasing the gods by placing crystal skulls in deep caves or building many temples are just two of those many paths...&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kXf7mDyDYuHg6oe8yTUIEA__original/img/f6-Au0KTnNR4nugSu2U-wPNbZCU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4604439.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kXf7mDyDYuHg6oe8yTUIEA__thumb/img/or9mAn4ClljY_wO_zvsLJDqs9tU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4604439.jpg@3.6732@90@2@4
150@Blood Rage@&quot;Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL&quot;&#10;&#10;In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan&rsquo;s warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnar&ouml;k has come, and it&rsquo;s the end of the world! It&rsquo;s the Vikings&rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&#10;&#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__original/img/Myy6IPDJDzLoPdXrPXVZcddBQoQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2439223.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__thumb/img/NLhVdU8xazrgS5dA6nVCYmN2DNI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2439223.jpg@2.8801@90@2@4
151@Dominant Species: Marine@Sixty-Something Millions of Years Ago &mdash; A great ice age has ended. With massive warming altering the globe, another titanic struggle for supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species.&#10;&#10;Dominant Species: Marine is a game that abstractly recreates a small portion of ancient history: the ending of an onerous ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.&#10;&#10;Each player will assume the role of one of four major aquatic-based animal classes &mdash; reptiles, fish, cephalopod or crustacean. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &ldquo;survival of the fittest.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Through wily action pawn placement, you will attempt to thrive in as many different habitats as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. You will also want to propagate your individual species in order to earn victory points for your animal. You will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration and adaptation actions, among others.&#10;&#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game &ndash; the final ascent of a vast tropical ocean and its shorelines &ndash; where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have their animal crowned the Dominant Species.&#10;&#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because there&rsquo;s a large asteroid heading this way....&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of the main ocean on earth as it might have appeared tens of millions of years ago. The smaller Hydrothermal Vent tiles will be placed atop some of the larger tiles throughout play, converting them into Vents in the process.&#10;&#10;The action pawns drive the game. Each pawn allows a player to perform the various actions that can be taken&mdash;such as speciation, environmental change, migration or evolution. When placed on the action display, a pawn will immediately trigger that particular action for its owning player. Dominant Species: Marine includes new &ldquo;special&rdquo; pawns that can be acquired during the course of play. These special pawns have enhanced placement capabilities over the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; pawns that each player begins the game with.&#10;&#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities, ongoing benefits, or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game species cubes will be added to, moved about on, and removed from the tiles in play (&ldquo;earth&rdquo;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile and score their controlled special pawns&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.&#10;&#10;Dominant Species Veterans&#10;&#10;For players of the original Dominant Species, this iteration introduces several key evolutions to the system (pun definitely intended): &#10;&#10;     Actions are taken immediately whenever a pawn is placed instead of waiting to execute actions after all pawns are on the board. This gives players a bit more flexibility in their strategy, doesn&rsquo;t increase game time when more pawns are acquired by players, and lessens the brain-burn quite a bit since it alleviates the burden of having to plan out an entire turn in advance. &#10;     Domination is no longer on a per-tile basis, and is no longer &lsquo;competitive&rsquo; with other players. In this game you check dominance for each element type over the entire earth, and whether or not you dominate an element type is independent of whether one or more opponents also dominate it. Domination of an element is how you acquire &ndash; and try to maintain &ndash; control of the special pawns.&#10;     Animals no longer have default special abilities. Now, players are dealt 3 Trait cards during setup, choosing one to keep and putting the others back in the box. The chosen Trait gives their animal one of eighteen unique abilities spread amongst the Trait cards. &#10;     Acquiring special pawns through domination gives a player great flexibility in planning and executing a strategy. Special pawns can &lsquo;bump&rsquo; an opponent&rsquo;s basic pawn in order to take an action that would otherwise be blocked. They can be placed anywhere on the action display (where basic pawns must be placed in top-to-bottom order only). There are powerful action spaces where only a special pawn can be placed. And at the end of the game, each special pawn awards its owner VPs according to its highest achieved dominance value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTBiMz6852dq3K_yfpgpLQ__original/img/tDNHjJ6160FjCjpY8oJuaNPQ7_k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5998666.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTBiMz6852dq3K_yfpgpLQ__thumb/img/JNsz6atITE84iWPiiq7ki1LaSGY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5998666.jpg@3.8667@150@2@4
152@Acquire@In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had taken liberties with some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas &#10;2008 - Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board &amp; tiles, redesigned stocks &amp; money&#10;2016 - Dated 2016 The current affordable mass-market edition. It looks at first sight to be similar to previous modern editions, but has been criticised for the use of inferior design choices such as hard-to-read grey-on-grey embossed slots and the unusual tile fonts. It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3C--kJRhi6kTPHsr9dNaWw__original/img/WeRigNSL9w0EP12b2EJfpHoh4M0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3299296.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3C--kJRhi6kTPHsr9dNaWw__thumb/img/EQqszaHS3n6XplVVGQfTZtGc8fE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3299296.jpg@2.5015@90@2@6
153@Nusfjord@Nusfjord is a tranquil fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.&#10;&#10;In the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep.&#10;&#10;As with Agricola and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions. Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space &mdash; which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKYqNPEE94Zk_q5Vtk527w__original/img/Bf35-bzWhSF8jMq8pfzubBxuNlU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3729070.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKYqNPEE94Zk_q5Vtk527w__thumb/img/b380XF_C0n--whN9elUn8jI__Yg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3729070.jpg@2.8526@100@1@5
154@Istanbul@There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.&#10;&#10;In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&#10;&#10;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.&#10;    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.&#10;    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.&#10;    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.&#10;    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who's reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHH9Mreen2sBcxV6ZsE3ew__original/img/pHIJibqf-DmlOQD3CfT_rAjGmc0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1885326.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHH9Mreen2sBcxV6ZsE3ew__thumb/img/Vzpg3sdeAbCy0IxSAoh1aH9nvDE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1885326.jpg@2.5826@60@2@5

Cards are allies, items, effects, conditions, and (for some characters) curses. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations.

161@Clans of Caledonia@Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.&#10;&#10;Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!&#10;&#10;The game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three phases:&#10;&#10;1. Players' turns&#10;2. Production phase&#10;3. Round scoring&#10;&#10;1. Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions, from building, to upgrading, trading and exporting. When players run out of money, they pass and collect a passing bonus.&#10;&#10;2. In the production phase, each player collects basic resources, refined goods and cash from their production units built on the game map. Each production unit built makes income visible on the player mat. Refined goods require the respective basic resource.&#10;&#10;3. Players receive VPs depending on the scoring tile of the current round.&#10;&#10;The game comes with eight different clans, a modular board with 16 configurations, eight port bonuses and eight round scoring tiles.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SPuwc6RJ6y4PnTH36Pegsg__original/img/GcuvCavv-ZZP5_O1kCTrZELuZdY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3511783.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SPuwc6RJ6y4PnTH36Pegsg__thumb/img/M_6Yxp0A_NbebWk3Mepinsm96WI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3511783.png@3.4669@120@1@4
162@Undaunted: Normandy@June, 1944: Through the D-Day landings, the Allies have seized a foothold on the beaches of Normandy. Now you must lead your troops forward as you push deeper into France and drive the German forces back. You will face intense resistance, machine gun fire, and mortar bombardment, but a great commander can turn the situation to their advantage!&#10;&#10;Undaunted: Normandy is a deck-building game that places you and your opponent in command of American or German forces, fighting through a series of missions critical to the outcome of World War II. Use your cards to seize the initiative, bolster your forces, or control your troops on the battlefield. Strong leadership can turn the tide of battle in your favor, but reckless decisions could prove catastrophic as every casualty you take removes a card from your deck. Take charge amidst the chaos of battle, hold fast in the face of opposition, and remain undaunted.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iCd6hMGDzsQ_UXh00iKsJA__original/img/QhbQ2AMud-_H0fliiSIvc0dowOU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4602347.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iCd6hMGDzsQ_UXh00iKsJA__thumb/img/QbOlBm7DZGP2ZBnGZ-YaD-py-UQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4602347.jpg@2.2524@60@2@2
163@Rising Sun@The great and forgotten Kami have returned from the underworld, displeased with the affairs of the Empire&rsquo;s present Sh&#197;&#141;gun. At the start of spring in the Great New Year, the Kami have gathered their sacred clans with one quest: reclaim the lands of Nippon and return them to their honorable, spiritual traditions. However, each clan is bound by their own proud traditions to a unique vision for this great return and must wage a powerful diplomatic war across eight provinces. Alliances must be forged, betrayal is inevitable, honorable standing rises and falls. Political mandates must be navigated and devastating war must be fought, each won by expert skill and cunning negotiation. And only one may stand victorious at the coming of winter. You, honorable Sh&#197;&#141;gun, lead one of these great clans. Do you have the strength of honor, virtue, and spirit, as well as the mastery of steel necessary to deliver on this ancient promise?&#10;&#10;Rising  Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan. Each player chooses a Clan and competes to lead theirs to victory by accumulating Victory Points over the course of the Seasons. Each Clan possesses a unique ability and differs in Seasonal Income, Starting Honor Rank, and Home Province.&#10;Over the course of the game, players will forge and break alliances, choose political actions, worship the gods, customize their clans, and position their figures around Japan. In the process, Honor is a palpable element in Rising Sun: Having high Honor gives several advantages, while having low Honor may grant the allegiance of the darker elements of the world. But above all, Honor settles all disputes: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor wins.&#10;&#10;In Rising  Sun, players are encouraged to use diplomacy, negotiation, and even bribery to further their cause. Players can make deals at any point in the game but no deals are truly binding.&#10;Victory Points can be gained in several ways, from winning battles, to harvesting the right provinces, to playing to the Virtues accumulated by your Clan.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of 4 rounds or Seasons: Spring, Summer, and then Autumn; when  Winter  comes,  the  game  draws to a close and players calculate bonuses to decide who is the winner. &#10;Each Season is divided into five phases: &#10;1) Seasonal Setup because every Season has a certain Season deck with different cards, &#10;2) Tea Ceremony in which players sit down and negotiate their Alliances for the Season, &#10;3) Political Phase during which players will select Political Mandates to prepare their Clans and position their forces,&#10;4) War Phase, during which players battle over several Provinces, and &#10;5) Seasonal Cleanup.&#10;&#10;As already mentioned, the start of the Winter Season signifies the end of the game. Peace falls over the land as it gets covered in white snow, and a new Emperor will rise under the power of the great Kami.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__original/img/pKJ1XyLN4hvHim5eRj2VJHijv1E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3880340.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__thumb/img/UNKv6MWzJUAwhhP7-ng6HoinRa8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3880340.jpg@3.2909@120@3@5
164@Ashes Reborn: Rise of the Phoenixborn@In Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn, a two-player expandable card game, players take on the roles of Phoenixborns, demi-gods and protectors of this world. These characters are the great saviors of their civilizations. Before they came into existence, the humans were plagued by monsters like chimeras that took away their lands and forced them to live in walled-off cities. When the Phoenixborns came, they fought off the chimeras and freed the lands for humans to take over once again.&#10;&#10;But the time of peace was short-lived. A prophecy arose that if one Phoenixborn was able to absorb enough Ashes of others, they would ascend into full gods and take mastery over this world. This, as well as humans' greed for land, fueled the War of Ashes. The great cities now fight among each other, each one of them with a Phoenixborn at its helm, and you will decide who will rise and who will fall to ashes.&#10;&#10;Ashes Reborn: Rise of the Phoenixborn, released in 2021, features the same Phoenixborn as in the original Ashes with the same cards, but some cards have been modified to balance them. (Publisher Plaid Hat Games estimates that about 30% of all cards across all expansions are being modified.) The rules have undergone a few changes as well, mostly to clarify powers. The Ashes Reborn 1.5 Upgrade Kit contains more than 350+ updated Ashes cards, along with an updated rulebook, allowing players to move from the original game to the new 1.5 rules.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BxBWqnm98y1qgk9cEmStgQ__original/img/QK9ku5RxaXxttpT_zA4-l-rSIX4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5868255.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BxBWqnm98y1qgk9cEmStgQ__thumb/img/hMH88NFG6vP60vUif6fTr1ctsOA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5868255.jpg@2.9029@120@2@4
165@Viscounts of the West Kingdom@Viscounts of the West Kingdom is set at a time when the King&rsquo;s reign began to decline, circa 980 AD. Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes. But peace is a tenuous affair. As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to lead and sought independence from the crown. Since finding favour in his courts, our future has also become uncertain. As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive. Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority, should there be a sudden shift in power.&#10;&#10;The aim of Viscounts of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle and acquiring deeds for new land. Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours. Each turn they will be travelling around the kingdom, looking to increase their influence among the various areas of society. The game ends once the Kingdom reaches poverty or prosperity - or potentially both!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kMgSC_kRlJWt3KLj5y0BxQ__original/img/t9ccf6x3PQiL5Cqn4-mePKUNC-E=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5230695.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kMgSC_kRlJWt3KLj5y0BxQ__thumb/img/2uNYQn2vHuNGrx5-dxc1h7Mh7Do=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5230695.png@3.4486@90@1@4
166@Saint Petersburg@On May 16th, 1703, Czar Peter laid the cornerstone for the first building in Saint Petersburg. Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (bringing victory points) may want to move in. But to accomplish this, one needs merchants who can provide the necessary Rubles, or the glory is over. The competition isn't sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose.&#10;&#10;Saint Petersburg has a board to tally victory points and to set out the four types of cards.  It is the cards themselves that players need to collect.  In each round &ndash; with the number of rounds dependent on the number of players and the randomness of card availability &ndash; players first pay for CRAFTSMEN who supply money for further purchases; then BUILDINGS to score points; then ARISTOCRATS, who are needed for money, points, and end-of-game scoring; and finally, unique cards from all three categories which give greater benefits. During the first rounds, players never have enough money to buy every card they want. During later rounds, they have plenty of money, but the cards they'd like to buy may have already come and gone...&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Sankt Petersburg: Das Bankett&#10;    Saint Petersburg: New Society & Banquet Expansion (includes The Banquet)&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yoidfpvt2eACASYUpbmsyg__original/img/UMVconG3O34fGHYeL7HqTiT3igI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic246360.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yoidfpvt2eACASYUpbmsyg__thumb/img/oN0BjMknoiCwD-o5qeSCOxVPKF0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic246360.jpg@2.4631@60@2@4

It offers a dynamic play experience where players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly.

168@Alchemists@In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories &ndash; correct theories, that is &mdash; and therein lies the problem.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.&#10;Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.&#10;&#10;During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Flavor text:&#10;Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad &mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.&#10;&#10;But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects &mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge, wealth, and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist's cauldron.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__original/img/SP4ItZ27dLweUPbz_bF7C-P7GtA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2241156.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__thumb/img/-a0oJ_E49V_7PDW78W7KIyS3rF8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2241156.png@3.9172@120@2@4

170@Praga Caput Regni@Charles IV has been crowned King of Bohemia and ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From his castle in Prague, he oversees construction of new fortifications: a bridge across the Vltava River, a university, and a cathedral rising within the walls of the castle itself. Prague is already among the largest cities in Europe. King Charles will make it the capital of an empire!&#10;&#10;In Praga Caput Regni, players take the role of wealthy citizens who are organizing various building projects in medieval Prague. By expanding their wealth and joining in the construction, they gain favor with the king. Players choose from six actions on the game board &mdash; the &quot;action crane&quot; &mdash; that are always available, but which are weighted with a constantly shifting array of costs and benefits. By using these actions, you can increase your resources, improve the strength of your chosen actions, and build &quot;New Prague City&quot;, the Charles Bridge, or city walls. You can possibly gain additional actions or even participate in the construction of St. Vitus Cathedral.&#10;&#10;Clever players will discover synergies between carefully timed actions and the rewards from constructing civic projects as all of the mechanisms mesh together. At the end of the game, the player who most impressed King Charles wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aUPeXVwc40xrgud2XeZwyA__original/img/WbCD6iqzBhVucS7uRwYvtku5zD0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5671087.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aUPeXVwc40xrgud2XeZwyA__thumb/img/1TYDRYM7iz0-jLJ-YZj6d5bhweg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5671087.png@3.7454@150@1@4

172@Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition@Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition is an engine-building game in which players control interplanetary corporations with the goal of making Mars habitable (and profitable). You will do this by investing mega credits (MC) into project cards that will directly or indirectly contribute to the terraforming process. In order to win, you will want to accumulate a high terraform rating (TR) and as many victory points (VP) as you can. Players raise their TR by increasing global parameters: oceans, oxygen, and temperature. TR also determines each corporation's basic income, and, at the end of the game TR counts as VP. Additional VP and production capabilities are awarded for building project cards and other actions taken during the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, and each round the players will choose one of five phases, which determines which activities will take place during that round. This means every round is different, but can consist of building new project cards, taking general and project-specific actions, producing income and resources (plants and heat), or researching to draw more project cards. Every player will take all the phases selected for the round, and will receive a special bonus during the phase that they selected. To speed up the game, players should resolve each phase simultaneously!&#10;&#10;The game board has tracks for oxygen, temperature, and terraform rating, as well as a place for all of the ocean tiles that will be flipped over the course of the game. The game ends when there is enough oxygen to breath (14%), oceans enough to allow Earth-like weather (9), and the temperature is well above freezing (+8&deg;C). It will then be possible, if not comfortable, to live on the surface of Mars!&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most VP at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eT_Atcy_vRJvuUMgYakNrQ__original/img/upZwrb6k8zZMNTwB8VfpI372yuo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6260098.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eT_Atcy_vRJvuUMgYakNrQ__thumb/img/YxoNRQg9owsoi68POaMY0Ix31ZI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6260098.jpg@2.9264@60@1@4
173@Lobbyist: Shaping the Vote@In the world of politics it seems nothing is every completely clear and many c operations work hard and spends millions to see that their interests are put before all others. In the game of Lobbyist - Shaping the Vote, players get to try their hand at lobbying, working to influence politicians to vote their desired way while competing with other lobbyist who are working towards a different means and outcome.&#10;&#10;Lobbyist - Shaping the Vote is a game where players take on the role of Lobbyist trying to influence the political committee to voting in their desired way. Each player is a lobbyist starting with $50,000. The board is a political committee voting on five issues, Education, Health and Welfare, Infrastructure, Taxes and Revenue, Crime and Punishment. Each issue's influence is represented by a dice value and Lobbyist play cards from their hand to increase and decrease those dice values. Around the board will be 5,7,or 9 (depending on difficulty of play) unique politicians, all with a voting position value for each of the five issues. Politicians will not vote yes until the die values matches or exceeds their voting position values. Each lobbyist it working to gather desired votes on these issues, wanting to gather yes votes on two issues, and no votes on two issues, being indifferent on the fifth issue (each player lobbyist card has different yes/no goals on their cards).&#10;&#10;Throughout the game players will have cards in hand and will draw and play a card on their turn. Most cards will allow then to influence one or more of the voting issue dice. Vote cards are shuffled into the deck and when one of these is drawn the player immediately plays the Vote card and the committee votes on the issues. Prior to voting though the Lobbyist all have one final chance to influence their politicians by either taking a vote action (indicted on the cards), or by spending up to $20,000 of their money to increase or decrease dice values. Once each player has had a chance to take or pass on an action, the politicians vote on the issues and players get yes/no vote tokens for their successful lobbying. Game ends after the fifth vote happens and final scores are tallied.&#10;&#10;I came up with this game idea after sitting through a number of political action committee meetings and hearing the same info numerous times, so I started jotting ideas. The can has been play tested some and everyone I have played with has enjoyed the game at this point.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vp1x5m1_bml8EK9xHjnKHQ__original/img/SrSp4dLMnGqP1A732gK0pnRqoYA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5399570.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vp1x5m1_bml8EK9xHjnKHQ__thumb/img/qX_OEs75e8x0mURt8kV26_ApARw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5399570.png@0@60@2@8
174@Cuba Libre@In December 1956, paroled rebel Fidel Castro returned to Cuba to launch his revolution with virtually no political base and&mdash;after a disastrous initial encounter with government forces&mdash;a total of just 12 men.  Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra&uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans&rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald&iacute;var.  Castro&rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.&#10;&#10;Castro&rsquo;s Insurgency&#10;&#10;Following up on GMT Games&rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro&rsquo;s &ldquo;26 July Movement&rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista&rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.  And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.&#10;&#10;COIN Series, Volume II&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players&mdash;both volumes share the same innovative Series: COIN (GMT) system.  Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4&mdash;and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss.  But Cuba Libre&rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes &hellip;&#10;&#10;&bull; The Twelve:  The first wave&rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra&mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?&#10;&bull; El Che and Ra&uacute;l:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?&#10;&bull; Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?&#10;&bull; General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?&#10;&bull; Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?&#10;&bull; Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?&#10;&bull; Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?&#10;&bull; Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics&mdash;will they help or hurt?&#10;&bull; Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob&rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?&#10;&bull; Sinatra:  Frankie&rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?&#10;&hellip; and much more.&#10;&#10;New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:&#10;&#10;&bull; It&rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.&#10;&bull; The Syndicate&rsquo;s bases are Casinos&mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them.  &#10;&bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the &ldquo;muscle&rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.  &#10;&bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone&rsquo;s hands&mdash;even the corrupt Government&rsquo;s.&#10;&bull; The Government has its own terror tactic&mdash;reprisals&mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.&#10;&bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.&#10;&bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end&mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!&#10;&#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves.

176@The Expanse Board Game@The Expanse, a board game based on the Syfy television series of the same name, focuses on politics, conquest and intrigue similar to the board game Twilight Struggle, although with a shorter playing time. The card-driven game uses key images from the show, along with action points and events that allow players to move and place &quot;Fleets&quot; and &quot;Influence&quot;.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players represent Earth's UN forces, the military of Mars, the rebels of the O.P.A., and the mysterious corporation Protogen Inc.

The game lasts four different eras, during which you develop technologies, create fine arts, erect buildings, and build wonders. You'll send explorers to discover the continents, found cities in distant lands, and send your soldiers into battles.&#10;&#10;The first player starting a Golden Age during an era chooses a &quot;History Judgement&quot; card that states the way all the players will score in that round. Each player who started a Golden Age continues taking money at his turns until all other players have passed.&#10;&#10;There are many ways to score points &mdash; artists, the judgement of history, wonders, technologies, attacks, money, secret future technologies, etc. &mdash; as well as many different ways to achieve a victory.

178@Sidereal Confluence@Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant is a singularly unique trading and negotiation game for 4-9 players. Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.&#10;&#10;Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is almost all simultaneous play.&#10;&#10;Sidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__original/img/1D98HsjtX5IzcwUMvd-67z1xzKo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4981297.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__thumb/img/ptUAPVk_LoqX7qDUt7ngtDXe-Qw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4981297.jpg@3.5461@180@4@9

180@Paladins of the West Kingdom@Paladins of the West Kingdom is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story, circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.&#10;&#10;The aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4nhokcLdYoo6ulbZ1rmGgA__original/img/9ktZDu003VVVTw0RxD-ufLYV1HQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4462987.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4nhokcLdYoo6ulbZ1rmGgA__thumb/img/1gEbke_bKTA6D2jjpPm1HowGGHM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4462987.png@3.6959@120@1@4
181@The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire@From the ashes of war, nations rise to power in the atomic age. Each player takes control of a nation struggling for power in the latter part of the 20th century. They build up their nation&rsquo;s industry, commerce, and government by acquiring resources, building structures, and tapping sources of energy. The price of oil is going up, and nuclear energy is the wave of the future. The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire is set in the same &quot;universe&quot; as The Manhattan Project, but it's a standalone game, not an expansion.&#10;&#10;The major threat in Energy Empire is not war, but uncertain global impacts, that result from side effects of industrialization and pollution. Many actions come with a cost. So, as nations become more industrious, they also increase the amount of pollution in the environment.  Careful use of science can mitigate the harmful effects of industry, and can also help avert global crises.&#10;&#10;Energy Empire uses worker placement, tableau-building, and resource management mechanics. On each turn, a player can choose to either work or generate. On a work turn, a player plays a single worker on the main board, then uses workers and energy to activate cards in their tableau. Players may spend energy to use an occupied space on the main board, so no spaces are ever completely blocked. On a generate turn, players get to renew their supply of energy by rolling &quot;energy dice&quot; that represent nuclear, coal, oil, solar, and other forms of energy.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-aaspZ2Oq1VuAADvbUoeww__original/img/fr4sH1ViKPtRys-gjCY4dY8UuQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3048617.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-aaspZ2Oq1VuAADvbUoeww__thumb/img/6nMV_Bdtm2ShipBJfGle36DY1-U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3048617.jpg@3.0387@120@1@5
182@Camel Up (Second Edition)@In Camel Up, up to eight players bet on five racing camels, trying to suss out which ones will place first and second in a quick race around a pyramid. The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win &mdash; should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when? That all depends on how the dice come out of the pyramid dice shaker, which releases one die at a time when players pause from their bets long enough to see who's actually moving!&#10;&#10;This 2018 edition of Camel Up features new artwork, a new game board design, a new pyramid design, engraved dice, and new game modes, including crazy rogue camels that start the race running in the opposite direction!

183@Sprawlopolis@Jackhammers chattering, trucks beeping, engines roaring, the sounds of construction are everywhere. Sprawlopolis is growing and YOU are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn't cut it, so the city turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this tiny town into a thriving civic center it's you.&#10;&#10;In Sprawlopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new city from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. Each turn, players will play 1 card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible. Players will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types. Watch out though, the city hates paying for road maintenance so each road will cost you points in the end. When all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met dynamically generated minimum score for their game.  Can you meet the demands of the officials, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate urban wonder?

184@Cthulhu: Death May Die@In Cthulhu: Death May Die, inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, you and your fellow players represent investigators in the 1920s who instead of trying to stop the coming of Elder Gods, want to summon those otherworldly beings so that you can put a stop to them permanently. You start the game insane, and while your long-term goal is to shoot Cthulhu in the face, so to speak, at some point during the game you'll probably fail to mitigate your dice rolls properly and your insanity will cause you to do something terrible &mdash; or maybe advantageous. Hard to know for sure.&#10;&#10;The game has multiple episodes, and each of them has a similar structure of two acts, those being before and after you summon whatever it is you happen to be summoning. If any character dies prior to the summoning, then the game ends and you lose; once the Elder One is on the board, as long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win.&#10;&#10;The episodes are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e8D09pfFsUsoX1D81EeoZg__original/img/8_FKwPd8bBL3PFjef8Yjz_sFWSk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4705171.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e8D09pfFsUsoX1D81EeoZg__thumb/img/j03wBmZg1Kp5QaaIu9p-O8XRqeU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4705171.jpg@2.4041@120@1@5
185@Mysterium@In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wfeAiLK5n5hD1omhnlYLLA__original/img/uhvKoYDfAsLg-nMkjQcbSJTDFmU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2601683.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wfeAiLK5n5hD1omhnlYLLA__thumb/img/NAl-NrSAmWvklSVr3hKrSwiszNA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2601683.jpg@1.9055@42@2@7

192@The Colonists@Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In The Colonists, a.k.a. Die Kolonisten, each player is a mayor of a village and must develop their environment to gain room for new farmers, craftsmen, and citizens. The main goal of the game is full employment, so players must create new jobs, educate the people, and build new houses to increase their population. But resources are limited, and their storage leads to problems that players must deal with, while also not forgetting to upgrade their buildings. Players select actions by moving their mayor on a central board.&#10;&#10;The Colonists is designed in different levels and scenarios, and even includes something akin to a tutorial, with the playing time varying between 30 minutes (for beginners) and 180 minutes (experts).&#10;&#10;The Colonists FAQ&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ca6hNgx3vX8dri1yj-3CWg__original/img/hVWz5MTXBBc4RCXAQvQ3pnZ7aFc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3195482.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ca6hNgx3vX8dri1yj-3CWg__thumb/img/NU1qPi1sLNOfIYLmc4lRyQXgHVo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3195482.jpg@4.0814@360@1@4

194@Jaws@In JAWS, one player takes on the role of the killer shark off Amity Island, while the other 1-3 players take on the roles of Brody, Hooper and Quint to hunt the shark. Character and event cards define player abilities and create game actions for humans and the shark. Gameplay is divided into two acts &mdash; Amity Island and The Orca &mdash; played on a double-sided board to replicate the film's story:&#10;&#10;&#10;    In the Amity Island phase, the shark menaces swimmers and avoids capture. Other players attempt to pinpoint the shark's location and save swimmers from shark attacks.&#10;    In the Orca phase, played on the reverse side of the game board, Brody, Hooper and Quint are aboard the sinking ship engaging in a climactic battle against the shark, while using additional action and strategy cards to defend the Orca from targeted shark attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;If humans kill the shark, they win; if the shark attack on the Orca succeeds, the great white shark wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UDv2zsY1rdWVOXyUl8faYg__original/img/XwsKpy2zpnujG6zXd959_Ts5hKE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4581181.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UDv2zsY1rdWVOXyUl8faYg__thumb/img/gOOR7Q9EdwxdjB9t2kgS1HFBs-0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4581181.jpg@2.1875@60@2@4
195@Mythic Battles: Pantheon@Hera, tired of Zeus' infidelity, decides to take her revenge and releases the Titans on Mount Olympus. In the ensuing battle, the power liberated by the combatants ignites in a combustion that shatters the Earth. In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.&#10;&#10;As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal. Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image.&#10;&#10;The world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland. Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx. Would that have been the extent of the underworld's involvement however...&#10;&#10;Hades, having lost the majority of his power, no longer holds sway over the Underworld. The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface.&#10;&#10;As a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power.&#10;&#10;In Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game. Choose your God, draft your warband and take the fight to your enemies with the might of the most powerful beings from Greek mythology at your back.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/au7lklR-A_0nnTskm4Vohw__original/img/zaRDFiH0FaeA_V73P-mpnKMfk9k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3235453.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/au7lklR-A_0nnTskm4Vohw__thumb/img/MPylcXlXo-YF-rsanQIy9DaaGcs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3235453.jpg@3.0427@90@2@4
196@Hannibal & Hamilcar@Hannibal &amp; Hamilcar: Rome vs Carthage is a 20th anniversary edition of the classic Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, an asymmetrical card-driven game for 2 players set in the time of the epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from the classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve political dominance.&#10;&#10;Hannibal was designed by the world-renowned Mark Simonitch. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants. Certain game mechanics have been streamlined, while producing exactly the same game results as the golden classic. Hannibal has won numerous awards (including the Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Award and the Golden Geek Best Wargame Award), and is currently ranked 11th in BoardGameGeek.com&rsquo;s Wargame rankings.&#10;&#10;The original rules and components were updated by Mark Simonitch and Jaro Andruszkiewicz. The development team at PHALANX has given the original game a careful, meticulous update. It is now easier and faster to play. It has received new artwork. The original game has been further enriched by the addition of two new expansions: Sun of Macedon and Price of Failure. These expansions are not Kickstarter exclusives, so they will be available as a separate products. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants as well as new graphics, miniatures, new custom dice, extra cards, and a new double-sided mounted board (with the Hannibal map on one side and the Hamilcar map on the other).&#10;&#10;Hamilcar, set during the First Punic War, is a companion game sharing components and using similar mechanics. It introduces a naval system and naval battles. Both players compete for control of the Mediterranean Sea in a conflict that will be described as a war between an elephant and a whale - the struggle of a land-based empire versus the world&rsquo;s naval power. Rome's goal was to break through the island chain of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia - Carthage's defensive line to contain Rome on the Italian peninsula.&#10;&#10;In both games players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHMTzdpZvTv7Ug4Mx0Lt7w__original/img/azUHdRQJh4UbYRXrkcKSLT4-b9g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3477797.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHMTzdpZvTv7Ug4Mx0Lt7w__thumb/img/gJivqHIFPn1Z_4PDoFqAAZfD4PE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3477797.jpg@3.9294@200@2@2
197@Trains@In the 19th century, shortly after the industrial revolution, railways quickly spread over the world. Japan, importing Western culture and eager to become one of the Grand Nations, saw the birth of many private railway companies and entered the Golden Age of railways. Eventually, as a result of the actions of powerful people and capitalists, many of these smaller companies gradually merged into larger ones.&#10;&#10;In Trains, the players are such capitalists, managing private railways companies and striving to become bigger and better than the competition. The game takes place during the 19th and 20th century in the 2012 OKAZU Brand edition, whereas the 2013 AEG/Pegasus edition is set in modern times, with bullet trains, freight trains and more. You will start with a small set of cards, but by building a more effective deck throughout the game, you will be able to place stations and lay rails over the maps of Osaka, Tokyo or other locations. The trick is to purchase the cards you want to use, then use them as effectively as possible. Gain enough points from your railways and you will ultimately manage the most powerful railroads in modern Japan!&#10;&#10;Trains is the first title in AEG's Destination Fun series!

198@Raptor@Mamma Raptor has escaped from her run and laid her eggs in the park. A team of scientists must neutralize her and capture the baby raptors before they run wild into the forest.&#10;&#10;Raptor is a card-driven board game with tactical play and some double guessing. Players use their cards to move their pawns &mdash; with the scientists on one side, Mother and baby raptors on the other &mdash; on the board. Every round, the player who played the lowest ranked card can use the corresponding action, while their opponent has movement or attack points equal to the difference between the values of the two cards. The scientists can use fire, can move by jeep on the tracks, and can even call for reinforcements, while the mamma raptor can hide in the bushes, yell to frighten the scientists, and call for her babies.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Ro5KFX55FbZBWehBy9LKg__original/img/17jLBJbMVzZssJLpRh503itz008=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6974678.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Ro5KFX55FbZBWehBy9LKg__thumb/img/yHZjXqMjgYpXCZZDVQsCJfABYA4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6974678.jpg@2.0769@30@2@2
199@Aeon's End@The survivors of a long-ago invasion have taken refuge in the forgotten underground city of Gravehold. There, the desperate remnants of society have learned that the energy of the very breaches the beings use to attack them can be repurposed through various gems, transforming the malign energies within into beneficial spells and weapons to aid their last line of defense: the breach mages.&#10;&#10;Aeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that require careful planning with every discarded card. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d50LceHj6LIafa4S_qIsCg__original/img/4MsKNGm47PU9BGW4i2yamMlRSQ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3189350.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d50LceHj6LIafa4S_qIsCg__thumb/img/KMFA-gXm_LbZpyXSAHbIZm-eAcQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3189350.jpg@2.7905@60@1@4
200@Yokohama@Once Yokohama was just a fishing village, but now at the beginning of the Meiji era it's becoming a harbor open to foreign countries and one of the leading trade cities of Japan. As a result, many Japanese products such as copper and raw silk are collected in Yokohama for export to other countries. At the same time, the city is starting to incorporate foreign technology and culture, with even the streets becoming more modernized. In the shadow of this development was the presence of many Yokohama merchants.&#10;&#10;In YOKOHAMA, each player is a merchant in the Meiji period, trying to gain fame from a successful business, and to do so they need to build a store, broaden their sales channels, learn a variety of techniques, and (of course) respond to trade orders from abroad.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ocI_xrJ7A-cDTTMUoYBNzw__original/img/7C0EpAhp67svA0XQ1FjuhrNvESU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3600984.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ocI_xrJ7A-cDTTMUoYBNzw__thumb/img/FV_oHALnYd3AHo0FPCfYMkSedBM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3600984.jpg@3.2976@90@2@4
201@Just One@Just One is a cooperative party game in which you play together to discover as many mystery words as possible. Find the best clue to help your teammate. Be unique, as all identical clues will be cancelled!&#10;&#10;A complete game is played over 13 cards. The goal is to get a score as close to 13 as possible. In case of a right answer, the players score 1 point. In case of wrong answer, they lose the current card as well as the top card of the deck. Thus losing 2 points. In case of lack of answer, the players only lose the current card, and therefore only 1 point.&#10;&#10;You have the choice &ndash; make the difference!&#10;&#10;Small Historical Point:&#10;&#10;Originally, Just One was called We Are The Word and was published by Fun Consortium.&#10;&#10;Repos Production bought the rights in early 2018 and adapted the game. The Sombrero-wearing Belgians decided to improve the quality of the components, add 50 new words, and change the name of the game. Following this new edition, the game went from having only a French edition to having a world-wide edition.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qKcKjHpzAvLddwBhyindag__original/img/NPUrOSJ5NEC7aPkoEXnTHJ7vICU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4268499.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qKcKjHpzAvLddwBhyindag__thumb/img/HhZu2qLp9wyX9PNgvmDE8_hCl-0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4268499.jpg@1.0499@20@3@7
202@7 Wonders@You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/35h9Za_JvMMMtx_92kT0Jg__original/img/jt70jJDZ1y1FWJs4ZQf5FI8APVY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7149798.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/35h9Za_JvMMMtx_92kT0Jg__thumb/img/BUOso8b0M1aUOkU80FWlhE8uuxc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7149798.jpg@2.3225@30@2@7
203@Ground Floor@The day has come. The paperwork is complete, the registration filed, and the business cards purchased &ndash; you're open for business! So now what? Where do you spend your time? Where do you spend your money? Which tasks are most important? What should take priority? Should you hire new employees? Or maybe invest in a marketing campaign? These are just some of the decisions facing you as a fresh entrepreneur who dreams of running a successful business. You must excel at balancing your time, money and staff because all are scarce and all are required to thrive.&#10;&#10;So barter with your fellow colleagues, manage your staff, collect information, expand your office, or schedule your next product shipment.

204@Targi@Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.&#10;&#10;The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.&#10;&#10;The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wHg4fOf48cs1kw1PDOk1tQ__original/img/St4ABQhpauYiq4Mt6-f38JtLOjM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3958793.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wHg4fOf48cs1kw1PDOk1tQ__thumb/img/6l-jqYlfECK1SVSsUs7FXUheKzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3958793.jpg@2.3446@60@2@2
205@Arkwright@In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century. Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.&#10;&#10;To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.&#10;&#10;You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.&#10;&#10;Each player has an own set of &quot;action tokens&quot; like &quot;build and modernize factories&quot;, &quot;employ new workers&quot;, &quot;improve quality&quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &quot;Administration board&quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (even numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).&#10;&#10;After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.&#10;&#10;Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.&#10;&#10;After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.&#10;&#10;Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.&#10;&#10;To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot;, but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute &quot;Waterframe&quot;-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42Arfn__U6EZcAj6biuh4w__original/img/mT2Oug5XPaSWIW0M-nNoZW4qmSY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2776693.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42Arfn__U6EZcAj6biuh4w__thumb/img/zM8pwB0LilhgIQd67L7mOgeZ25o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2776693.png@4.5992@240@2@4
206@Panamax@After one hundred years in service, the Panama Canal still is one of the most important and impressive engineering achievements in modern times.&#10;&#10;Built in 1914, it held a prominent role in the deployment of military vessels during WWI and in the conflicts that have followed. Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.&#10;&#10;In the wake of the Canal&rsquo;s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard&mdash;designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.&#10;&#10;In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col&oacute;n Free Trade Zone. Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends. At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.&#10;&#10;Panamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system&mdash;&ldquo;pushing&rdquo;  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round. Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies. Each Company has a limited amount of Stock that the players can purchase in exchange for investing&mdash;receiving a dividend each round. The questions for the players will be which companies are likely to yield higher dividends?&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s more to explore and several ways to win, but we ask that you join us at the table and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Panama Canal with a session of Panamax!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DjHtKvuSHMdYslgNFyzw1w__original/img/VopILYltj9H--2JkBn2o7Sms-ps=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1786212.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DjHtKvuSHMdYslgNFyzw1w__thumb/img/bz4ZAigiXzNCwbFnFScPkczKfvw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1786212.png@3.749@120@2@4
207@This War of Mine: The Board Game@This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city.&#10;&#10;You will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city, enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity.&#10;&#10;During day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements&rsquo; shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, you&rsquo;ll try to keep it warm.&#10;&#10;Upon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.). On your way you will meet tens of characters, each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit, thieves, bandits, soldiers, war victims, refugees, neighbors, traders and members of local communities), each encounter is a potential, unique adventure. To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous).&#10;&#10;Your goal is to SURVIVE until the cessation of war hostilities. During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices (you will have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later in the playthrough). Survival itself will often prove not to be enough. The price each of you will decide to pay, might be too high in the final outcome. So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made. The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here.&#10;&#10;TWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant. You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from the electronic version of the game and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices.&#10;&#10;The boardgame significantly broadens the original game&rsquo;s universe and emphasises the depth of plot, yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making.&#10;&#10;The project aims to omit the usual boardgame threshold - TWOM: The Board Game is an INSTANT PLAY game, with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure.&#10;&#10;Experience the simulation of a struggle for survival as a group of civilians facing a blind and merciless war.&#10;&#10;In war, not everyone is a soldier.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQOQW7p1RWHzY54Lrs-_pA__original/img/PSC8BO2njNcBJhxvi0IV5Jb5hgo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3315915.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQOQW7p1RWHzY54Lrs-_pA__thumb/img/qmypl6agXd78n1_vAiO5LZcCXHc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3315915.jpg@3.2868@120@1@6
208@Hadrian's Wall@When visiting the North of Britannia in 122 AD, the Roman Emperor Hadrian Augustus witnessed the aftermath of war between his armies and the savage Picts. In a show of Roman might, he ordered a wall to be built that would separate the Pict tribes from the rest of England. Grand in its design, the wall stretched 80 Roman miles, from coast to coast. Hadrian's Wall stood in service to the Roman Empire for nearly 300 years before its eventual decline. Today, Hadrian's Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the remains of the forts, towers, and turrets can still be explored.&#10;&#10;In Hadrian's Wall, players take on the role of a Roman General placed in charge of the construction of a milecastle and bordering wall. Over six years (rounds), players will construct their fort and wall, man the defenses, and attract civilians by building services and providing entertainment &mdash; all while defending the honor of the Roman Empire from the warring Picts. The player who can accumulate the most renown, piety, valor and discipline, whilst avoiding disdain, will prove to the Emperor they are the model Roman citizen and be crowned Legatus Legionis!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4XzRDw3VrgNpNfZlzZl66w__original/img/SfU1sNqUtpcvhcdzspDb5M9uSQQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5608818.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4XzRDw3VrgNpNfZlzZl66w__thumb/img/dGMBL60RMtAfcx741phN75mqlnA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5608818.png@3.128@60@1@6
209@Whirling Witchcraft@Being a witch is all about wielding powerful magical ingredients &mdash; but a witch can wield only so much power before everything blows up in their face. Choose your recipes wisely to clear your workbench and stick others with too much raw material because the first player to overflow their nemesis' cauldron with enough ingredients wins!&#10;&#10;In Whirling Witchcraft, you start with a hand of four recipe cards, as well as a number of ingredients on your workbench; ingredients come in five types, and you have a limited number of spaces for each type on your workbench.&#10;&#10;Everyone plays simultaneously during each round. You all choose and reveal a recipe from your hand at the same time, then you can use as many recipes in play in front of you as you wish to convert and transform ingredients. Maybe you'll turn a mushroom into the harder-to-find mandrake, then you can turn two mandrakes (using an older one and the one you just created) to make three mushrooms. You can use each recipe at most once a round, and when you're finished, place all of the final ingredients into a cauldron, then pass it to your neighbor on the right. They must then fit all of these ingredients on their workbench &mdash; and if they can't, they must return the &quot;extra&quot; ingredients to you for placement in your &quot;Witch's Circle&quot;.&#10;&#10;If you now have at least five ingredients in your Witch's Circle, the game ends and you win; otherwise you all pass your recipe cards in hand to the player on your left, refill your hand to four cards, then start a new round.&#10;&#10;The game includes personality cards you can use to give each player a unique power, in addition to a different set of starting ingredients. Some recipes can be played in either of two directions to help you customize how you transform ingredients, and recipes might also have arcana symbols that give you bonus powers when you collect enough of them.&#10;&#10;Can you put together the right cookbook to land your neighbor in hot water?&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vghbon6jnyUg6oPQju7DyQ__original/img/mXoGk0Cpiww8k1OpjyCkC3M6FAM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6088814.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vghbon6jnyUg6oPQju7DyQ__thumb/img/f_RJWJWlwfOWdRGBqcy-32QAZ8c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6088814.jpg@1.9048@30@2@5
210@Middara: Unintentional Malum – Act 1@Middara is a 1-4 player cooperative choose-your-own-adventure style miniatures board game. Players assume the role of a party of adventurers in an ultra-modern fantasy setting that exists alongside our very own Earth.  During the game, players will experience an in depth, fully narrative-driven adventure that contains over 90 hours of content. Throughout the narrative you and three of your friends will confront real decisions that change the course of the story and its outcome.&#10;&#10;Players will face many dangerous adversaries throughout the story and will take part in heated combat with these foes. Middara features an innovative, dice based combat system for these encounters.  Based on their equipment and abilities, players will have access to unique two-dice combinations that will increase their attack and damage potential in a variety of ways. In addition to numbers, dice have a particular set of symbols on each face that can be spent according to players currently equipped weapons and abilities.  With nine different types of dice, over 110 unique abilities and 150 unique pieces of equipment the possibilities for different character builds are endless.&#10; What makes Middara so compelling is that the outcomes of story decisions and encounters have far-reaching effects that determine how the story moves and resolves. Friends and family might get killed, or they may survive. Maybe the players avoid some problems entirely, only to be faced with a whole new challenge.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Features:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Narrative-driven campaign that contains over 90 hours of content.&#10;    Unique dice-based success system featuring multiple dice that players can upgrade throughout the campaign. &#10;    36 modular map tiles representing different locations in the world, such as magical forests, caves, and swamps!&#10;    A.I. controlled monsters, NPCs, challenges, traps, and other narrative-driven obstacles.&#10;    Campaign character progression via a point buy system allowing players to ditch traditional classes and instead focus on building the character they want to play.&#10;    Over 110 unique Disciplines and over 150 unique pieces of equipment.&#10;    Stand alone scenarios for when you aren't playing with your campaign group, or even when you are!&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hRuD1y5BxdNpssgBqamS0A__original/img/yyJfhGhGV9cvzvAjnVsopysHNNM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4595897.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hRuD1y5BxdNpssgBqamS0A__thumb/img/fpUu1t2YLjJ4EvEzBGTKtZasNv4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4595897.jpg@4.0078@60@1@4
211@Meadow@Meadow is an engaging set collection game with over two hundred unique cards containing hand-painted watercolor illustrations. In the game, players take the role of explorers competing for the title of the most skilled nature observer. To win, they collect cards with the most valuable species, landscapes, and discoveries. Their journey is led by passion, a curiosity of the world, an inquiring mind, and a desire to discover the mysteries of nature. The competition continues at the bonfire where the players race to fulfill the goals of their adventures.&#10;&#10;In this medium-weight board game for 1-4 players, you take turns placing path tokens on one of the two boards. Placing a token on the main board allows the player to get cards, but playing them requires meeting certain requirements. Playing a token on the bonfire board activates special actions (which helps to implement a chosen strategy) and gives the opportunity to achieve goals that provide additional points. Throughout the game, players collect cards in their meadow and surroundings area. At the end, the player with the most points on cards and on the bonfire board wins.&#10;&#10;Meadow also includes envelopes with additional cards to open at specific moments...&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9r3qdPijtgoIN24PxFU2gw__original/img/tHQTKwwk4N8J5fpWhsoE8t0FQhw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5894745.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9r3qdPijtgoIN24PxFU2gw__thumb/img/tugW5aKyC6Vs31QaBX8YvmQiPTQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5894745.jpg@2.2216@90@1@4
212@Small World@In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.&#10;&#10;Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.&#10;&#10;Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!&#10;&#10;On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go &quot;into decline&quot;. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aoPM07XzoceB-RydLh08zA__original/img/bYLzrwZO9u-3h2wyU-PHc8aTOY4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic428828.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aoPM07XzoceB-RydLh08zA__thumb/img/o3Bw9heVDJRgPYlI_PksCvLAgnM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic428828.jpg@2.3519@80@2@5
213@Las Vegas@Developer Stefan Br&uuml;ck at alea describes Las Vegas as &quot;an easy, dice-rolling, fun-and-luck game with a lot of interaction and 'schadenfreude'&quot;. Who doesn't love schadenfreude? (Well, other than those being schadened, I suppose...)&#10;&#10;In more detail, Las Vegas includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.&#10;&#10;Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked &quot;1&quot;. You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the money associated with it. In case of a tie, the next non-tied player takes the highest-valued money card at that casino.&#10;&#10;Las Vegas rates a 1 out of 10 on alea's difficulty scale.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQJ0HRKx2mobP0g3FCeR_Q__original/img/0lvxwLBBElto13XPMisB0ZCTSkA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1261796.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQJ0HRKx2mobP0g3FCeR_Q__thumb/img/7g-l6beAu5RtsAykBhoO7kMWexc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1261796.jpg@1.181@30@2@5

Each Feature Film Box features a unique Killer and and iconic Location, and the more Feature Films you have, the more killer/location combinations you can experience!&#10;&#10;In game terms, Final Girl shares similarities with Hostage Negotiator, but with some key differences that change it up, including a game board to track locations and character movement. You can choose from multiple characters when picking someone to play and multiple killers when picking someone to play against.

215@Chess@Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.&#10;&#10;The game has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, and became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0-DjGBOko6RV8zg5ejhYIg__original/img/0pn_QgMuWaIJb2Q7aZNfORse0_o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic260745.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0-DjGBOko6RV8zg5ejhYIg__thumb/img/kjtoinSrkYV0HZleXMxkJzZwS8k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic260745.jpg@3.6784@0@2@2

We offer fully comprehensive streaming in music and threedee, news and sitcoms, classic movies and sensies. We cover it all. Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that's fit to view.&#10;&#10;Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&#10;&#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&#10;&#10;The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs. While the cards in this set have been released previously, the art on some of them is new.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2ewHIIG_TRq8bYlqk0jIMw__original/img/cassW39WF2QrPImJF59efADAmM0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3738560.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2ewHIIG_TRq8bYlqk0jIMw__thumb/img/IJaOyyQ7Y59tW6nbKbjTMTFt-Ls=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3738560.jpg@3.398@45@2@2

The team has only seconds to assess the situation and devise a plan of attack &ndash; then you spring into action like the trained professionals that you are. You must face your fears, never give up, and above all else work as a team because the fire is raging, the building is threatening to collapse, and lives are in danger.&#10;&#10;You must succeed. You are the brave men and women of fire rescue; people are depending on you. This is what you do every day.&#10;&#10;Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game of fire rescue.&#10;&#10;There are two versions of game play in Flash Point, a basic game and expert game.&#10;In both variants, players are attempting to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging building fire.&#10;As the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building, causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building.  Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles.  If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose.  Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.&#10;&#10;The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.  The game includes a double sided board with two different building plans and several expansion maps are available.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v6bTbxeprDFj1nN4AenvjA__original/img/ri91i22ujLCZqxXKhFIdVDPGe8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1129370.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v6bTbxeprDFj1nN4AenvjA__thumb/img/7AyBFA8JfZHKxC5ntwOjJTbIgWE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1129370.jpg@2.2022@45@2@6

These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles.

220@Warehouse 13: The Board Game@The Warehouse is a massive, top-secret government facility in South Dakota that houses dangerous and fantastical objects. Agents assigned to the Warehouse risk their lives to retrieve these artifacts to keep them away from nefarious individuals who seek to use the artifacts for personal gain. In Warehouse 13: The Board Game, players take on the role of Warehouse Agents who must work together to retrieve these artifacts. But is everyone looking out for the Warehouse's interests, or might one of the Agents be secretly working for the Warehouse's most ruthless adversary?&#10;&#10;Warehouse 13: The Board Game can be played by three to five players in about two hours. Each game of Warehouse 13: The Board Game is considered a Season, played over a series of Episodes. Each Episode will involve the investigation and retrieval of one artifact. Warehouse Agents must investigate clues, then use those clues to retrieve the artifact. However, one player is the Traitor, who secretly works for the Adversary. For every artifact that is lost, the Adversary becomes more powerful and thereby more difficult to defeat.&#10;&#10;Each Episode begins with the Ping Phase, in which the artifact's location is revealed and clue dice are rolled. Clues are represented by 13 custom six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;After the Ping Phase, the Investigation Phase begins. During the Adversary turn, the Adversary will act. Afterwards, each Agent must perform an Action, such as drawing Traits, playing a Trait, performing Warehouse Maintenance, or traveling to the Field. Next, each Agent must attempt to claim a clue die. If an Agent cannot claim a clue die, one must be neutralized, removing it from play for the remainder of that Episode. Finally, each Agent must draw a free Trait.&#10;&#10;The Investigation Phase repeats until all of the clue dice are either claimed or neutralized, then the Retrieval Phase begins. Each artifact displays symbols that correspond to the symbols on the clue dice. During each round of the Retrieval Phase, the players secretly roll all of their clue dice and each player chooses one to apply to the artifact. The chosen dice are revealed simultaneously. The Adversary will intervene by rolling Goo dice which can neutralize clue dice. If enough clues are applied to match the artifact's symbols, the artifact is retrieved. If the Agents run out of clue dice before rolling enough symbols, the artifact is lost to the Adversary.&#10;&#10;Play then continues to the next Episode. After three artifacts are retrieved, the Warehouse Agents win. However, if three artifacts are lost, the Finale begins, in which the Agents have one last chance to thwart the Adversary's grand scheme.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the Traitor is hidden. The Traitor can impact the game by failing to assist the Warehouse Agents, by failing to claim clues, or by failing to apply clues properly. If the Agents believe they have determined who the Traitor is, they can vote to Bronze that player, which reveals their Loyalty.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xkhubY9kZqnmc3U3A-CEZw__original/img/tNaWd_0V6N0UEysOJ-B5ObUlkI8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3358873.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xkhubY9kZqnmc3U3A-CEZw__thumb/img/Tm6Iaj7cjPVMow0VfYdif5KF9EY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3358873.jpg@3.1@150@2@5
221@Hanabi@Hanabi&mdash;named for the Japanese word for &quot;fireworks&quot;&mdash;is a cooperative game in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by placing the cards on the table in the right order. (In Japanese, hanabi is written as &#232;&#138;&#177;&#231;&#129;&#171;; these are the ideograms flower and fire, respectively.)&#10;&#10;The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered 1&ndash;5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1&ndash;5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.&#10;&#10;An extra suit of cards, rainbow colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play.&#10;&#10;Hanabi was originally published as part of Hanabi & Ikebana.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDVksMwfcqoem1k_xtZrOA__original/img/5vNHZiTEhK4aRDuGXv5KImp9cmQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2007286.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDVksMwfcqoem1k_xtZrOA__thumb/img/amCeCcEKhYGbVtDvpvIMnu3qTg0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2007286.jpg@1.6943@25@2@5
222@Quodd Heroes@Quodd Heroes is a fast-paced modular, scenario-based adventure board game that plays like a combination of Super Smash Bros., Mario Kart and Legend of Zelda all wrapped into one. Whether it&rsquo;s a simple point-to-point rally-style race, capture the flag or a quest to uncover hidden secrets each game is filled with unexpected events, lots of player interaction, ever-changing boards and a dash of mayhem.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism in Quodd Heroes is something you&rsquo;ve never seen before. Each player controls a different cube-shaped character miniature and player board.  You then assign a different movement skill to five of the six sides of your character (the sixth side has an ability unique to your character). When you begin the movement phase on your turn you &ldquo;tumble&rdquo; your character into an adjacent space and perform the movement skill associated with the face-up side of your character. Skills include: Tumble, Jump, Slide, Diagonal Slide, and Dash.&#10;&#10;While you work to complete the scenario&rsquo;s objective(s), either on your own, cooperatively, or against other players, game boards which are laid out in grids present obstacles like walls, raging rivers, chasms, moving platforms, rotating board sections, trap doors, tunnels, teleporters and more. As you navigate the world you create new obstacles and shortcuts while battling your opponents by pushing them into pits, blocking their paths and fouling their plans.&#10;&#10;As you explore the world you will find food, runes, items and pets in the form of cards. These cards enhance your abilities, slow your opponents and modify the world around you. If you use your movement skills and cards strategically you'll emerge as the greatest of the Quodd Heroes.&#10;&#10;Player Turn Structure:&#10;&#10;1. Play cards (power up): Play as many cards as you like from your hand. Power up and alter the board prior to movement.&#10;&#10;2. Movement Phase: Perform your natural tumble by turning your hero miniature over into an adjacent space, activate any board elements on that space, then activate the movement skill associated with the side of your character that is now facing up. Move up to your maximum distance with that skill in any direction you like.&#10;&#10;3. Play card (recover phase): You many play any additional cards you like during this phase.&#10;&#10;4. Exploration phase: draw cards from the lineup of cards or the top of the deck equal to your exploration value&#10;&#10;At the end of each round an upkeep phase includes:&#10;&#10;- moving board elements and animals&#10;- play a world event card that effects all players&#10;- Adjust round tracker (in timed scenarios)&#10;- all heroes upgrade their hero by selecting an upgrade tile and placing it in their upgrade track.&#10;- First player mark passes to the left&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r_ponwLZ3U8NeHPwAPTiww__original/img/bl_kxbLkdgVdlf-Dop3I2KFyCM8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3796365.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r_ponwLZ3U8NeHPwAPTiww__thumb/img/0QoNFpmSRaxKeKpTNTV4X9aHxgQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3796365.jpg@3.1714@90@1@6

A series of unique Dreams await to be discovered through tense exploration and tactical encounters.&#10;&#10;Learn about the Dreamers, their forgotten past, and their desperate mission. Uncover the surreal, sprawling dreamscapes. Just don't be surprised when---just like dreams often do---they become a little disturbing... Prepare to be challenged by escape-room like riddles. Spot a clue in the image. See a hidden link between several pieces of information. Use your instinct as much as your logic.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, you'll explore the Dreamworld, trying to find out what this is all about and who you are &ndash; and you are there for a specific reason, but, at first, you can't remember too much. You'll have to restore your memories from scattered pieces.&#10;&#10;The rules are pretty straightforward at the beginning, but they will grow more and more complex during the campaign. New rules open new possibilities and, sometimes, may turn everything upside down.&#10;&#10;Deckbuilding in Etherfields applies to almost every deck in the game, not only the players' ones.

224@Diplomacy@This classic game of pure negotiation has taken many forms over the years.&#10;&#10;The first The Avalon Hill Game Co version has perhaps the widest release, but Avalon Hill re-released the game in 1999, complete with a colorful new map and metal pieces.  In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.&#10;&#10;In the game, players represent one of the seven &quot;Great Powers of Europe&quot; (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 3&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Colonial Diplomacy&#10;    Diplomacy: Classical Variant&#10;    Diplomacy: Hundred Variant&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nogL4_97ys563HqEIM3PVA__original/img/3fX1_H105KO-2CklUSV0mEAkFZQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic288149.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nogL4_97ys563HqEIM3PVA__thumb/img/wUYjxwvojOdn49sfV646SJ8GC54=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic288149.jpg@3.3455@360@2@7
225@Loopin' Louie@In Loopin' Louie, a battery-powered motor placed in the center of the table rotates a boom with a little plastic plane. Four radial arms lead out to the players' barns and the chickens they're trying to protect. Each barn has a little lever, which is used to knock the rotating plane away from your chickens and hopefully into someone else's. When only one player has chickens remaining, he or she wins the game. Very silly and very addictive.&#10;&#10;Extremely similar versions of the game, but with different themes, are available.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e9CWevSJC03NzLybnCKEVQ__original/img/FZ8ti8jTLQPuHuQHWDt0hE6YHDs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4025029.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e9CWevSJC03NzLybnCKEVQ__thumb/img/vQZYNWt9xSZez7NCoMB5Lz9yBdY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4025029.png@1.0527@10@2@4
226@Taj Mahal@Northwest India at the beginning of the 18th century. The rule of the Grand Moguls is waning, and the Maharishis and princes seize the opportunity to take control of the region. By influencing the prominent forces, building magnificent palaces, and ensuring a steady supply of commodities, the princes increase their power until the most successful has won.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to gain the most influence points. These can be obtained by building palaces and by acquiring commodities. A palace can be built after securing the support of the Vizier, the General, the Monk, the Princess, or the Grand Mogul. Commodities are gained by seizing control of a region or by retrieving them on a space where a palace has just been built.&#10;&#10;There are twelve turns with an auction for the region control and the support of the Vizier, General, Monk, Princess, and Grand Mogul, each represented by a different symbol. Players use cards in four colors to bid for the various prizes, and each player may only play one color in any given turn. During your turn you can either increase your bid by playing more cards or withdraw. When you do, you gain the reward for every symbol you have the majority of. You place palaces, gain region tiles, and increase your score accordingly. There are bonus points for connecting palaces over several regions on the map.After the final area on the board is auctioned, the player with the highest point total wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is #3 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;Note: the 2018 edition from Fantasy Flight Games includes rules for 2 players. You use only the cards included in the game, so no additional components are required. Anyone could use these rules with any version of the game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1AbjSJSVWFJ5GEXriWLd0w__original/img/pUWU53usRd2ck1OAXApT5haZUW4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4092498.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1AbjSJSVWFJ5GEXriWLd0w__thumb/img/Hl5F3BOBmcd-NmdNfkbDHbqheNo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4092498.jpg@2.9936@90@2@5
227@Black Orchestra@As Hitler's grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination. As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot;, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?&#10;&#10;Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).&#10;&#10;But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.&#10;&#10;On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions &mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling &quot;Conspire&quot; action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.&#10;&#10;After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.&#10;&#10;To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &quot;Target&quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &quot;Eagles&quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.&#10;&#10;Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mvE22ut60-N5qzhE9guINw__original/img/1GrE_UvDfOYRPMSqcv9DaKrJ-98=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6973676.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mvE22ut60-N5qzhE9guINw__thumb/img/Z2A_CL-vc5wS4_hUN2RhtGzMiC4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6973676.png@2.4258@90@1@5

231@Schotten Totten@In Schotten Totten, nine boundary stones lie between you and your opponent.  In front of each, you build poker-like formations of three cards on a side.  Whoever plays the higher-ranking formation wins the stone.  And in a unique twist, you may use your powers of logic to claim a stone even before your opponent has played all three of his cards, by demonstrating that the stone is impossible for him to win.  Successfully claim five stones, or any three adjacent stones, and you win the game.&#10;&#10;In 2000 GMT published a rethemed version as Battle Line which includes an extra 10 &quot;tactics&quot; cards that modify the standard game play, and with cards that run from 1 to 10 (instead of 1 to 9).&#10;&#10;The 2004 Edition of Schottentotten has these &quot;tactics&quot; cards too.&#10;Schotten-Totten FAQ.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/69mwXe7c6HNYmT6S35Y4zg__original/img/C5YBiD7Qhpkf5FO1GteEjo9KRVE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2932872.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/69mwXe7c6HNYmT6S35Y4zg__thumb/img/97DW-2XWDrSSkgy3XnUJ7f7tLiQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2932872.jpg@1.7133@20@2@2
232@De Vulgari Eloquentia@Italy, late Middle Ages. The fabric merchants need to write down their contracts in a language that everyone can understand and the literates are looking for an alternative to the elite of the traditional Latin language. So, the Volgare, the language spoken by the common people, taken from the dialects spoken in the various Italian regions, starts to gain relevance. During this period, Francesco D&rsquo;Assisi writes his famous Canticle of the Sun and Dante writes the Divine Comedy, both written in Volgare.&#10;&#10;The players will have to do their part in the creation of this new language! But who will provide them the proper knowledge to understand the manuscripts in the different dialects? Who will succeed to uncover the secrets of the books inside the Papal Library? Who will embrace the religious life and who will remain a merchant? Some of the players can become a famous banker, someone else can climb the church&rsquo;s hierarchy to be the next Pope! But in the end, who will be the most appreciated and respected for his status and his culture?&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to obtain more Volgare points. The players will gain VP from reading manuscripts, looking for important documents like the Canticle of the Sun or &quot;The Riddle from Verona&quot;. Players can also gain VP by improving their social status, for example, if the merchant becomes a banker or the Friar becomes a Benedictine Monk or the Cardinal becomes Camerlengo or Pope. Moreover, VP can be gotten with money and with the support of Politicians, Noblemen, Abbesses, and the Amanuensis.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mAyx-NXFYvTj6Dz-YKormQ__original/img/Ch4TL5VvsCZGDrEfAvpA65Drym8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic778029.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mAyx-NXFYvTj6Dz-YKormQ__thumb/img/k56Pz_BhVJ2ojAzx9Z5BeZth3pQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic778029.jpg@3.6238@120@2@5
233@Dawn of the Zeds (Third Edition)@The postcards in every local drug store read, &quot;Welcome to Fabulous Farmingdale!&quot;, an ad campaign that was the brainchild of Mayor Hernandez (who coincidentally employed his wife's public relations firm to market their community). But right now, things are far from fabulous in Farmingdale and, for once, everyone isn't blaming the Mayor. Some kind of virus or poison is turning ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. It is not clear how the disease spreads (though it seems that physical contact is certainly one way), but it is obvious what the illness does to its victims.&#10;&#10;These undead, nicknamed &quot;Zeds&quot; from the local newscasts as the acronym for &quot;Zombie Epidemic Disease,&quot; are now converging on your corner of the world around Farmingdale.

234@Indonesia@Judging by the smirk on the face of the Sultan of Solo, the businessman from North Sumatra has just made a mistake. And a costly one at that, too. He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan&rsquo;s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java. And the Sultan is now dripping in cash &mdash; he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing. Or he might invest in building an oil imperium. But wait &mdash; what&rsquo;s that young fellow over there up to? Buying all the shipping lines? That might change the outlook &hellip; considerably, in fact &hellip; let&rsquo;s see&hellip;&#10;&#10;Indonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.&#10;&#10;Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__original/img/ujxqaJuxawHp28WMvjv4JyUp0ac=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic93485.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__thumb/img/RCh0FVF5BT9-ATms0Wc_6hs2z5I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic93485.jpg@3.979@240@2@5
235@Wendake@&quot;Wendake&quot; is the name that the Wyandot people use for their traditional territory. This population, also known as the Huron Nation, lived in the Great Lakes region, together with the tribes who formed the Iroquois Confederacy, and many others. In this game, you will explore the traditions and everyday life of these tribes during the 1756&ndash;1763 period, when the Seven Years&rsquo; War between the French and the English took place in these territories.&#10;&#10;But this white man&rsquo;s war is only a marginal aspect of the game; the focus is on life in the native villages, fields, and forests. In this game, you won&rsquo;t find the traditional tipis, which were used by southwestern tribes who moved their camps to follow the bison herds. The natives of the Great Lakes were more sedentary, living in longhouses. The women farmed beans, corn, and pumpkins, while the men hunted beavers in the forests, mainly to sell their pelts as leather.&#10;&#10;In Wendake, you step into the shoes of the chief of a Native American tribe. You will have to manage the most important aspects of your tribe&rsquo;s daily existence, thereby earning points on the Economic, Military, Ritual, and Mask tracks. The core of the game is the action selection mechanism: you will have the opportunity to choose better and better actions over 7 years (i.e., rounds), and the winner will be the chief who finds the best combinations of actions and uses them to lead their tribe to prosperity!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/N_oaV30_ImihsgPhYAUyiQ__original/img/BfzNBdQu-iHq3nA9Dfnwhz06EyQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4110410.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/N_oaV30_ImihsgPhYAUyiQ__thumb/img/5Ux0lbcU6kZPSGW3SpKFQhdw9ww=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4110410.jpg@3.5895@120@1@4
236@Star Wars: Outer Rim@Take to the stars and become a living legend in Star Wars: Outer Rim, a game of bounty hunters, mercenaries, and smugglers for 1-4 players!&#10;&#10;In Outer Rim, you take on the role of an underworld denizen, setting out to make your mark on the galaxy. You'll travel the outer rim in your personal ship, hire legendary Star Wars characters to join your crew, and try to become the most famous (or infamous) outlaw in the galaxy!&#10;&#10;But it won't be easy since the warring factions of the galaxy roam the outer rim, hunting down the scum that have proven to be a thorn in their side, and other scoundrels looking to make their mark see you as the perfect target to bring down to bolster their own reputation. Do you have what it takes to survive in the outer rim and become a living legend?&#10;&#10;In more detail, a game of Outer Rim takes place over a series of turns that sees players taking dangerous jobs, tracking down bounties, upgrading their ship, and more, all in service of gaining more and more fame. Regardless of the path you take to get there, your goal is to gain ten fame, which can come from a variety of sources, such as completing your character's personal goal, collecting on bounties and jobs, delivering illegal cargo, taking down patrols from the various factions struggling over the galaxy, and enjoying the finer things in life by purchasing luxury items with your hard-earned credits.&#10;&#10;While the path to victory may be different for scoundrels finding their way in the Outer Rim, everyone starts from the bottom with a simple starship. Your player board not only tracks your fame progress, but also contains slots for your ship, your character card, gear, reputation, modifications, jobs, and bounties.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RjwAj6hw5aEMGvosEA12gw__original/img/jQUkqrDd0lOX6IRGq5Cbj1junL4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5879810.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RjwAj6hw5aEMGvosEA12gw__thumb/img/Ri6aOjHVFhgu_xK_xuBoCOCck-A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5879810.jpg@2.4959@180@1@4
237@6 nimmt!@In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JFhLVSRFQ2mtWRNHgbZ3Wg__original/img/9fIiXGmstIfL7rLvn9pNXM1Bw6Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2602138.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JFhLVSRFQ2mtWRNHgbZ3Wg__thumb/img/jqJgikalfbCRPAMpjq4bWH0sj08=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2602138.jpg@1.201@45@2@10
238@Grand Austria Hotel@In the thick of the Viennese modern age, exquisite caf&eacute;s are competing for customers. Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf&eacute; into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your caf&eacute; become the Grand Austria Hotel.&#10;&#10;The start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.&#10;&#10;But no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.&#10;&#10;With 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value. Each game stands on its own and demands new tactics and strategies.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d4It-gdWY4GZVYSjbq20gQ__original/img/q--Mlcev3k1VtDfk37jK_v26750=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2728138.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d4It-gdWY4GZVYSjbq20gQ__thumb/img/b_KgnMcnGbqF9xc3DdfLvVT-6Wo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2728138.jpg@3.215@120@2@4

240@Onitama@Onitama is a two-player, perfect information abstract game with a random starting set-up. On a 5x5 board, both players start with five pawns on their side, with the main pawn in the middle.&#10;&#10;Each player has two open cards that each display a possible move for any of her pieces. There is a fifth card that cannot be used by either player. On a player's turn, she chooses one of her cards, moves one of her pieces according to the chosen card, then replaces the card she used with the fifth card. The other player then chooses one of his cards, moves accordingly, and exchanges that card with this fifth card &mdash; which is, of course, the card the first player just used.&#10;&#10;Moving onto one of the opponent's pawns removes that pawn from the game. Taking the opponent's main pawn, or moving your main pawn into your opponent's main pawn's starting space, wins you the game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GJKuOCy5HGAYgVH_Rei5mA__original/img/oRsIxp72iv58128KFdqvjG6Gz64=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7070194.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GJKuOCy5HGAYgVH_Rei5mA__thumb/img/Q3W4poMS4btD-HZLervgqbSCtmE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7070194.jpg@1.6755@20@2@2

243@Manila@Barges, freight and profits are what it's all about in Manila, a speculative contest for 3-5 players. Goods shipments, intended for transport along sea routes, are in danger of gathering dust in the warehouses or being lost at sea in a storm. While the players speculate about success and failure, the ultimate fate of the ships will be determined by the dice.&#10;&#10;There are four shipments that need to get to Manila - jade, ginseng, silk and nutmeg. A round begins with an initial auction to become harbour master. If you win, you'll be allowed to buy a share of one of the shipments, choose which three shipments you'd like to take down river and how likely they are to make it to their destination in the harbour. If they make it to Manila, their share price will increase. The aim of the game is to bet on the outcome of these shipments, with dice ultimately determining their fate. How many of the three boats will make it and which ones? Would you like to provide insurance against possible failed ships or perhaps you think pirates will snatch a chance to take control? Manila is a fun family game that takes minutes to learn and brings the river boats of the Philippines to life!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dU0cm4_NP8QiQqiXP9Jclw__original/img/WxzkPQdX41PI-Lz-94wPL1ZrEQk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic902372.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dU0cm4_NP8QiQqiXP9Jclw__thumb/img/fgRQKglhHBKsRP-nUi0EE-iuxvM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic902372.jpg@2.0321@60@3@5
244@Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men@Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men is a collectible dice-building tabletop game designed by Quarriors! creators Michael Elliott and Eric M.

245@Inis@Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis). Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QE8mnPFmauoj2THsyUYPA__original/img/6bZdn1SNbpIqU7n5pwtncvdNE_U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4739757.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QE8mnPFmauoj2THsyUYPA__thumb/img/m63hnvHi6jqlva52FGaWbEqzjys=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4739757.jpg@2.8833@90@2@4
246@Above and Below@Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.&#10;&#10;Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.&#10;&#10;With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.&#10;&#10;Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?&#10;&#10;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:&#10;&#10;     Villager Tool tokens&#10;     Lost Villagers&#10;     Swamp Villagers&#10;     Exclusive Stretch goals:&#10;     Creature Villagers&#10;     Quest Tokens&#10;     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book&#10;     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book &#10;     Wooden Goods&#10;&#10;&#10;This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0wpvRmBe65e4vwGf0Jbpg__original/img/gIlpowYQ7XzumYO0jZyVldxosBA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2398773.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0wpvRmBe65e4vwGf0Jbpg__thumb/img/jHLwKKWiJ-lHoaNIj0TrKAGm7QM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2398773.jpg@2.5278@90@2@4

Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals. There's lots to do and many paths to becoming the best suburban architect in Welcome To...!&#10;&#10;Because of the communal actions, game play is simultaneous and thus supports large groups of players.

249@Radlands@Radlands is a competitive, dueling card game about identifying fiercely powerful card synergies.&#10;&#10;Act as the leader of your post apocalyptic group of survivors in a tooth-and-nail fight to protect your three camps from a vicious rival tribe. If all of them are destroyed, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;The main resource in the game is water. You will spend it to play people and events, and to use the abilities of cards you already have on the table. People protect your camps and provide useful abilities, while events are powerful effects that take time to pay off.&#10;&#10;Both players draw cards from the same deck. All cards can either be played to the table or discarded for quick &ldquo;junk&rdquo; effects. To win, you will need to manage your cards and water wisely.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YpQUtpxNtDHBF5eVcwzBtQ__original/img/br-kw0KuyBfH1mrxZ0kgVrF9UMc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6478338.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YpQUtpxNtDHBF5eVcwzBtQ__thumb/img/tN06HL-O6O-ayKHxEio9xYoJym0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6478338.png@2.2404@40@2@2
250@Techno Bowl: Arcade Football Unplugged@TECH? NO! &#10;Forget about expensive game systems, emulators, disconnected online games, and high-priced yearly roster updates. TECHNO BOWL takes everything you love about arcade and video game football classics like Tecmo Bowl, NFL Blitz, and Madden and puts it all on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;1UP&#10;And as if that isn&rsquo;t cool enough, it also gives you a feature that gamers have long asked for but never gotten&hellip; until now! What is it you ask? As a coach in TECHNO BOWL, you will design your own formations and plays. That&rsquo;s right. Let me say it again. You get to design your own formations and plays.&#10;&#10;And I&rsquo;m not talking about choosing several formation cards, lining up elements on a chart, or utilizing some other abstraction. This is putting the power to effortlessly create real football formations and plays into your hands.&#10;&#10;ZERO DOWN TIME&#10;Thanks to the BOX SPORTS ENGINE, there is almost zero down time in the game [except for half time and timeouts of course!]. Coaches are constantly involved, and the on-field players are always interacting with one another as skill checks and ever evolving plays result in: free actions, reactions, read-and-reacts, and offensive and defensive adjustments. Add to that real world timers for setting up formations and selecting plays, and you have a truly dynamic fast-paced tabletop football experience.&#10;&#10;UNPARALLELED FOOTBALL GAMEPLAY&#10;TECHNO BOWL delivers that authentic football feel like no game before it. Establish the running game by punching it in between the tackles or tossing it to a back for an outside sweep. Launch an air offensive while sitting in the pocket or throwing on the run with laser accurate throws directly to the receiver or exciting route passes where you lead the receiver in hopes of beating the coverage. Defense can run man, zone, and mixed defensive packages and bring the blitz. Oh, can it bring the blitz!&#10;&#10;No matter which strategy you choose, the gameplay will look, feel, and flow like a real football play.&#10;&#10;OPTIONS&#10;TECHNO BOWL is all about options, and there&rsquo;s a game mode, team, and play style for everyone. You even have the option to run an option!&#10;&#10;MODES&#10;There are five different modes of play. Each of these brings a different experience to the table.&#10;&#10;- TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with no skills and no field goals.&#10;- ALL TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with skills but no field goals.&#10;- INFERNO! It&rsquo;s ALL TECHNO with more awesome and fire! [more later]&#10;- PRO is 8-vs-8 with no skills but includes field goal rules.&#10;- ALL PRO is 8-vs-8 with skills and field goal rules.&#10;&#10;Each of these modes offers a completely different game experience, and I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. How does adding an extra couple of players to the field [and the ability to kick field goals] equate with an entirely different mode? Trust me. Having that extra player on both sides of the ball quite literally changes everything.&#10;&#10;MAD SKILLS&#10;When playing in modes that utilize special skills and abilities, coaches will have access to three types of players:&#10;&#10;- IMPACT&#10;- STAR&#10;- SUPERSTAR&#10;&#10;These players will come equipped with one or more of the 26 skills found in the game. That count of 26 skills doesn&rsquo;t even include core fundamentals or INFERNO MODE specific skills.&#10;&#10;SKILL&#10;Speaking of skills, TECHNO BOWL is a game of skill and not a random &lsquo;dice fest&rsquo;. The 2d6 rolls used for skill checks mean that coaches won&rsquo;t fall prey to straight-line probabilities or random chaos. Winning is about getting the right match and modifiers to deliver a high percentage roll, having a plan when you get an unusually poor result, and knowing the right time to make a high risk roll for a shot at a very high payoff. Of course, your formations, play calling, and player positioning create these opportunities.&#10;&#10;PLAYMAKER DIE&#10;The PLAYMAKER die powers some of the special skills in the game like stiff arms and spin moves allowing for sophisticated passive abilities to be triggered without the need for complex rules.&#10;&#10;TEAMS&#10;There are 32 teams in the MORE FUN LEAGUE [MFL], and each of these has its own unique play style. This means that you&rsquo;re not just trying to get into the head of the coach that&rsquo;s sitting across the table from you, but that you have to take into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of the players on the specific rosters that you and your opponent are using.&#10;&#10;PLAYER SKILL RATINGS&#10;The player skill rating system ensures that coaches and spectators will know how well or poorly a player performs fundamental actions by simply looking at the jersey number! No need to look at charts or extended stat lines. The league skill cap manages team composition so that you are never taxed to remember an insane number of special abilities or which players have them. Coaches get beaten by other coaches and NOT the rules.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the More Fun League!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bBv4KEE47e8TiLbWueD9MQ__original/img/o687RUdOWpwftZuWHIXgpOnFnyk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2918767.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bBv4KEE47e8TiLbWueD9MQ__thumb/img/E1KQoNhNlPt1pH5pebqGbojoqJs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2918767.jpg@2.7222@90@2@2

The landscape of Isle of Skye is breathtaking and fascinates everyone.&#10;&#10;In the tile-laying game Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King, 2&ndash;5 players are chieftains of famous clans and want to build their kingdoms to score as many points as possible&mdash;but in each game only four of the sixteen scoring tiles will be scored.&#10;&#10;Thanks to the scoring tiles, each game is different and leads to different tactics and strategies, but having enough money is useful no matter what else is going on. Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player with the best kingdom&mdash;and not the richest player&mdash;becomes the sovereign of the island.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GCxsnITFBO1pNXiBYkq_qA__original/img/8uoTbz4B_M1GbT4N3vGN-bhZF2Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2524838.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GCxsnITFBO1pNXiBYkq_qA__thumb/img/0BJUretj0lJj09f2JjDGrQzmakI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2524838.jpg@2.2504@50@2@5

255@Munchkin@&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Publisher's Description&#10;&#10;Go down in the dungeon. Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;Admit it. You love it.&#10;&#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&#10;&#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Other&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sequels:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&#10;    Munchkin Bites!&#10;    Munchkin Booty&#10;    Munchkin Conan&#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&#10;    Munchkin Fu&#10;    Munchkin Impossible&#10;    Munchkin Legends&#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&#10;    Munchkin Zombies&#10;    Star Munchkin&#10;    Super Munchkin&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Related Board Games&#10;&#10;&#10;    Munchkin Quest&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

256@Tigris & Euphrates@Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/soAzNVWglCdVBacNjoCTJw__original/img/HClVZy9phFP-NPte4UBQpclsaHU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2338267.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/soAzNVWglCdVBacNjoCTJw__thumb/img/0UPEyOaSFyqEH1ikrSig_218RQ0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2338267.jpg@3.5026@90@2@4

While the job is perilous, fame and fortune await.&#10;&#10;Discover the capital city where most of your actions will take place using a rondel action system.

Deliver goods and heroes to the best destinations and gain fame for your bravery! Balance the money you earn with the height of your fame because your final score after a number of game rounds will reflect the lowest of these two values.&#10;&#10;After all, what good is a purse full of the coin if the people don&rsquo;t sing songs about you, and what good is a song with an empty mug of ale?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m0097WIpBdC7tdA-mVi5Fw__original/img/bd3RYiimI4iWs2w1u27_2w4ImOI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5252479.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m0097WIpBdC7tdA-mVi5Fw__thumb/img/vGQx16-veWt64dxdrQA8w2VlsHA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5252479.png@3.1653@120@1@4
258@Fantastic Factories@It's a manufacturing arms race! Compete against other players as you try to build the most efficient set of factories in the shortest time. You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!&#10;&#10;In Fantastic Factories, you race to manufacture the most goods or build the most prestigious buildings. There are elements of dice rolling, worker placement, engine building, resource management, tableau building, simultaneous play, and some card drafting. Each round is split into two phases, the market phase and the work phase.&#10;&#10;During the market phase, you choose to either acquire a new blueprint for free or pay to hire a contractor. Blueprints are used to construct new factories during the work phase. Contractors can be used to reinforce your strategy by providing resources or allowing you to roll additional dice. You need to be mindful of what cards are available in the marketplace and the strategies your opponents may be pursuing.&#10;&#10;During the work phase, all players simultaneously roll their dice and use their dice as workers to run factories. Factories start as blueprints and need to be constructed. Once constructed, each factory can be used once each turn. Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct sequence can enable a powerful chain of actions. Additionally, you can build training facilities that allow you to manipulate the dice values of your workers. Each work phase is like solving a unique worker placement puzzle in order to optimize your output of resources and goods.&#10;&#10;Once any player has manufactured 12 goods or constructed 10 buildings, the game end is triggered and one additional and final round is played. The player with the most points wins (combination of building prestige and manufactured goods). With over 30 unique blueprints and countless synergies across buildings, each game is unique. Fantastic Factories offers a lot of replay value and satisfaction as players discover new factory engines with each game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;A large collection of solo puzzles have also been created for Fantastic Factories along with official tools to create more.

259@At the Gates of Loyang@At the Gates of Loyang is a trading game in which you are able to produce goods by planting them and later selling them to customers. You can use the abilities of some helpers to increase your income or production.&#10;&#10;Fields, customers, helpers, and miscellaneous objects are represented by cards. Each player receives two of these cards per round distributed by a bidding/drawing mechanism in which you end up with one of the cards you draw and one of the cards of a public offer filled by all players. Additionally, to these cards you always receive one field for free each round.&#10;&#10;Placing one good on a field fills the complete field with goods of this type. Each round, one unit per field is harvested. After planting, harvesting, and distributing cards, each player can use as many actions as he wants, only limited by the number of his cards or the number of goods he owns. At the end of his turn, he can invest the earned money on a scoring track, where early money is worth more than late money.

260@Roads & Boats@In Roads &amp; Boats, players start with a modest collection of donkeys, geese, boards, and stone. With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.&#10;&#10;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.&#10;&#10;Third edition (and later) player transporter tokens were upgraded to shaped wooden tokens.&#10;For its 20th Anniversary, Roads &amp; Boats has an edition that contains the &amp;cetera expansion: Roads & Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V-uqqRB-Ybm6oD5jWv9cSw__original/img/pOBZTUAqNmdJzkhEuFkxxnaGedk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic713985.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V-uqqRB-Ybm6oD5jWv9cSw__thumb/img/mJ6WPCY8ub5LWFnpCnusv42WNhI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic713985.jpg@4.1911@240@1@4
261@Raiders of the North Sea@Raiders of the North Sea is set in the central years of the Viking Age. As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!&#10;&#10;To impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement &mdash; whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress &mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hXdfAhgZ8OeyWLunt36wlw__original/img/f5wjooKB2dGPBlBzws5cDsuuJ-k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3578101.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hXdfAhgZ8OeyWLunt36wlw__thumb/img/vh7ttK5C_kKf5YZNYOY4vfsgXHU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3578101.jpg@2.5404@80@2@4
262@Troyes@In Troyes (pronounced &quot;twah&quot;), players recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France. Each player manages their segment of the population (represented by a horde of dice) and their hand of cards, which represent the three primary domains of the city:  religious, military, and civil. Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them &mdash; anything for more fame!&#10;&#10;Make your underlings:&#10;&#10;&#10;     work on the cathedral&#10;     combat misfortune&#10;     bustle about the city&#10;     and other such tasks that are below your family's stature&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Many editions of Troyes released in 2016 or later include rules for a solo variant as well as four bonus cards originally released in 2011 as a promotional item. Versions released prior to this date contain rules only for games with 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fBIe-aEPtJKC-ceNlspK6A__original/img/otcIVdG4ebZmK1SjUtzma18JtJ4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic750583.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fBIe-aEPtJKC-ceNlspK6A__thumb/img/Npv5mrWBkjnlKjl_8hGLNk9CCwc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic750583.jpg@3.4644@90@1@4
263@Zoo Break@A modern, cooperative take on the classic zoo escape premise.&#10;&#10;EMERGENCY! A computer malfunction at the Bedlam Zoo has short-circuited the gates for all the enclosures and the animals are escaping and making their way to the zoo exit. You will work together with your fellow zookeepers to round up all the animals and lock their enclosures before it's too late.&#10;&#10;Zoo Break is a crisis-management game that requires dynamic and cooperative problem-solving. You will spend your turn deciding how to use limited actions to move about the board, collect and trade supplies, capture animals, and lock cages, all while evading injury and coping with other challenges caused by the animals marauding through the zoo. Escape and Move cards control the animals with maximum variability, leading to endlessly different game scenarios.&#10;&#10;Success hinges on the keepers' ability to anticipate, adapt, and make strategic decisions, applying their skills and resources to regain control of the zoo. It's complex and suspenseful enough to keep adults riveted, but also playful and inviting to ambitious, game-loving kids. (Difficulty can also be regulated using a simple card selection mechanism at the start of the game.)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZeDyZIQ4GCE9Hmdk0sZZIQ__original/img/PVmdyA02HuMvMx01ttpHVNH1Mzg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4450350.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZeDyZIQ4GCE9Hmdk0sZZIQ__thumb/img/seHegPJ1ycqNHC17Qni9vs0M5t4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4450350.png@2.25@45@2@5
264@Trajan@Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture.&#10;&#10;The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you &ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.&#10;&#10;All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/djdeCr__iNV5rMnGnxNiaQ__original/img/-pxFp0FHDLLZK_hMT5kHG7IAQ7M=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4336095.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/djdeCr__iNV5rMnGnxNiaQ__thumb/img/jULoayRVuV3c8cRqKOPsf7oMO5w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4336095.png@3.6534@120@2@4

266@Kingsburg@In Kingsburg, players are Lords sent from the King to administer frontier territories.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns.  In every year, there are 3 production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops.  Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army.  Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.&#10;&#10;The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council.  Players place their influence dice on members of the Council. The player with the lowest influence dice sum will be the first one to choose where to spend his/her influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.&#10;&#10;Each adviser on the King's Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner.&#10;&#10;Many alternate strategies are possible to win: will you go for the military way, disregarding economic and prestige buildings, or will you aim to complete the big Cathedral to please the King?   Will you use the Merchant's Guild to gain more influence in the Council, or will you go for balanced development?&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pHFQxD8va6vOrrNfazVzsg__original/img/LKINGoSbAufYYSAElNZDOubbYZg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic253057.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pHFQxD8va6vOrrNfazVzsg__thumb/img/C5cCKKfjEpm87frQIFOOYfzmIyc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic253057.jpg@2.4244@90@2@5
267@Kingdomino@In Kingdomino, you are a lord seeking new lands in which to expand your kingdom. You must explore all the lands, including wheat fields, lakes, and mountains, in order to spot the best plots, while competing with other lords to acquire them first.&#10;&#10;The game uses tiles with two sections, similar to Dominoes. Each turn, each player will select a new domino to connect to their existing kingdom, making sure at least one of its sides connects to a matching terrain type already in play. The order of who picks first depends on which tile was previously chosen, with better tiles forcing players to pick later in the next round. The game ends when each player has completed a 5x5 grid (or failed to do so), and points are counted based on number of connecting tiles and valuable crown symbols.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3h9W8BfB_rltQ48EBmHliw__original/img/DDk3fDr0FkDpkYAcny5LeekB2qg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3132685.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3h9W8BfB_rltQ48EBmHliw__thumb/img/RGpbcY90eBcNLXbHLMBwLrr2uzo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3132685.png@1.218@25@2@4
268@The Castles of Burgundy@The Castles of Burgundy is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round, all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round, players take their turns in the current turn order. During their turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of their dice and place it in the staging area on their player board.&#10;    Place a settlement tile from the staging area of their player board to a space on their player board with a number matching one of their dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile.&#10;    Deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice.&#10;    Take worker tokens that allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to these actions, a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on their player board. If an action triggers the awarding of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit: additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last player finishes their turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers and for undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The 2019 edition of The Castles of Burgundy includes eight expansions, seven of which were previously released as promotional items and one new to this release.&#10;This edition has one fewer Monastery boards than what came in The Castles of Burgundy: 4th Expansion &#226;&#128;&#147; Monastery Boards&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VrNrk7XVU1hN0j1ZFhjcjw__original/img/IYxnn0KV56lDy18_0e23DSLcMso=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4934938.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VrNrk7XVU1hN0j1ZFhjcjw__thumb/img/6XPO0XNGGw3V77NjWR0K7Y33fqc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4934938.jpg@2.9639@120@1@4

271@Corrosion@In Corrosion, each of you manages a factory and deploys engineers to build up diversified scoring and production engines. In the steam-filled air, however, your biggest enemy is time because most machines and gears rust away quickly, so you are well advised to also produce chrome gears and invest in rustproof and powerful chrome machines.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can either play an engineer card or turn the corrosion wheel of your factory:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Playing engineers mostly gains you new machines and qualified engineers. Other players can copy your engineer's action by playing an engineer of the same suit but a higher grade.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Turning your corrosion wheel puts your machines to work and returns engineers to your hand, but also causes old gears and machines to rust.&#10;&#10;&#10;To be successful, you must cleverly co-ordinate your engineers and corrosion wheel and smoothly shift from one efficient engine to the next.&#10;&#10;The game end is triggered once the special point supply or the award supply run out. Then, whoever was able to score the most points with their machines and awards wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/utvlrrmevsn9Cb_Fs6kqlg__original/img/RaBq18EZJjT-of7KeYntJevVhwg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6329299.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/utvlrrmevsn9Cb_Fs6kqlg__thumb/img/CjNBS17ZhTbUnnc2F7grdDBk4Us=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6329299.jpg@3.25@120@1@4

273@Riverboat@Riverboat posits each player as the owner of a 19th century farm on the bank of the Mississippi River. You need to organize your workers to ensure that the fields are ordered according to their type and harvested when ready so that the goods can be shipped to New Orleans.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game lasts four rounds, and at the start of each round players draft phase cards until they're all distributed. The phases then take place in numerical order, with the player who chose a phase being the first one to act. In the first phase, players place their workers in the fields, with each player having the same distribution of colored field tiles, but a different random placement for each player. In phase two, players organize their crops, trying to group like types together, with some fields requiring two or three workers. In phase three, players harvest crops and load riverboats, with a dock needing to be filled with all the goods of a single type before it can be loaded. In phase four, the boats are launched and players can take special actions, with additional victory points possibly coming in phase five.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2sERfmFw2sWOkeIKBNlpkg__original/img/_eT0mk8OHuBJR1J697vCbgbv--c=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3812239.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2sERfmFw2sWOkeIKBNlpkg__thumb/img/Wd71rMfkQuT9JD21wnyBMfC8Bw4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3812239.png@2.9011@90@2@4

277@Sakura Arms@Sakura Arms &mdash; known in Japanese as &#230;&#161;&#156;&#233;&#153;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#233;&#151;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#146; &mdash; is a two-player dueling game in which players first choose two of seven megami (Japanese goddesses), each of which has a different keyword that empowers some of their cards. Players then see what the opponent chose before assembling a deck of ten out of 22 cards, with the players choosing cards both to take advantage of their own megami powers and to exploit their opponent's weaknesses. Players then duel to see who will be victorious.&#10;&#10;The game uses a single kind of token to represent life, distance, aura (defense), and flare (special energy) based on the zone these tokens occupy. By moving tokens between zones, you attempt to gain the ideal position and set up as many attacks as possible &mdash; or be prepared to avoid attacks.&#10;&#10;The gameplay at its core is simple, and due to its limited environment, it is relatively easy to learn the cards for a deck-building game. Building a deck and playing normally takes less then 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;&#10;This is the first release for the 2nd version of the Sakura Arms game system. A 3rd version, with system changes and balance updates, has since been released.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IMslo9J8RnWXQospAjO6Dw__original/img/DPPq9spt37SJlliXpyqKXFVwu_4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3545811.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IMslo9J8RnWXQospAjO6Dw__thumb/img/72su9RSHg1kxt9MApnodqc76f6Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3545811.jpg@3@30@2@2
278@On Mars@Following the success of unmanned rover missions, the United Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars Exploration (D.O.M.E.). The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment Mars Base Camp, private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony. As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company&rsquo;s private agenda.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet's surface. As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food &mdash; the necessities for survival.&#10;&#10;Do you dare take part in humankind&rsquo;s biggest challenge?&#10;&#10;On Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase &#226;&#128;&#139;and the Shuttle Phase&#226;&#128;&#139;.&#10;&#10;During the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet&rsquo;s surface with your rover. In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.&#10;&#10;All buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony&rsquo;s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.&#10;&#10;During the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__original/img/GNjjsgxq7wYO9pSIteDJe6Sxt00=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4357658.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__thumb/img/4GFbhkEWyIublXmikE2Tep6wSIQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4357658.jpg@4.664@150@1@4
279@Llamaland@The plateaus are wild, stunningly beautiful, and...full of llamas?!&#10;&#10;Being a farmer in Llamaland isn't exactly easy with all the hills and mountains around, but even so, growing potatoes, corn, and cocoa on the slopes of the mountains is what you love.

282@Cthulhu Wars@Cthulhu Wars is a strategy boardgame in which the players take the part of alien races and gods taken from the Cthulhu mythos created by H. P. Lovecraft. The game is physically large, and includes sixty-four  figurines of the cultists, monsters, aliens, and Great Old Ones that range in height from approximately 20 mm to nearly 180 mm.&#10;&#10;The game takes place on a map of Earth. Each player takes the part of one of four factions included in the base game. At the start of a turn, players Gather Power, then, during a series of Action Rounds, they spend this Power to accomplish various tasks, such as recruiting Cultists, moving units, engaging in battle, summoning monsters, building Gates, casting spells, and Awakening their Great Old One. When all players run out of Power, the Action phase ends and the next turn begins. Victory is determined by accumulating points on the Doom Track. The first player to 30 is the lone victor *if* he has unlocked all six of spell books.&#10;&#10;Driving the strategy are a player's wish to expand his power base, and his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction's spell books. Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spell books, and special abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spell books. All factions have multiple strategies open to them.&#10;&#10;The base game supports 2-4 players (the map supports 5 players), but with new factions and maps released as expansions it can support up to 8 players.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AUd4nmguSljr9qvkUCF2XQ__original/img/1wLZ2_huuT7TXul4uDxq7SsM5Ns=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3527761.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AUd4nmguSljr9qvkUCF2XQ__thumb/img/YZMG9iA4STGd32xvQHgEjw5Fctg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3527761.jpg@3.1423@120@2@4

284@Bruges@Bruges in the 15th century &ndash; culture and commerce flourish and make the Belgian Hanseatic city into one of the wealthiest cities in Europe.&#10;&#10;In Bruges (a.k.a. Brugge or Br&uuml;gge depending on the country in which you live), players assume the role of merchants who must maintain their relationships with those in power in the city while competing against one another for influence, power, and status. Dramatic events cast their shadows over the city, with players needing to worry about threats to their prosperity from more than just their opponents...&#10;&#10;The game includes 165 character cards, with each card having one of five colors. On a turn, a player chooses one of his cards and performs an action, with six different actions being available: Take workers, take money, mitigate a threat, build a canal, build a house, or hire the character depicted on the card. In principle, every card can be used for every action &ndash; but the color of the card determines in which areas the actions can be used or the strength of the chosen action, e.g., blue cards provide blue workers and red cards help mitigate red threats. All of the action is geared toward the gathering of prestige, with the most prestigious merchant winning in the end.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A8JeebUT3mu4zUmYs9clDQ__original/img/v5d03Jz4di-I6S6C1iihj6JEeoY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1652004.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A8JeebUT3mu4zUmYs9clDQ__thumb/img/0O-Yp8KcLpb_lUXGm3AgymPJKos=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1652004.jpg@2.7467@60@2@4
285@Petrichor@Petrichor is the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil. The word is constructed from Greek (&pi;&#206;&#173;&tau;&rho;&alpha;) petra, meaning &quot;stone&quot;, and (&#225;&#188;&#176;&chi;&#207;&#142;&rho;) &#196;&#171;ch&#197;&#141;r, the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods in Greek mythology.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the lush world of Petrichor; you are a cloud. Your entire purpose in life is to expand, sire other clouds and water crops. Unfortunately, your mates (who are also clouds) have a similar plan. It&rsquo;s up to you to manipulate the weather and assimilate these rogue clouds to contribute to the growth of as many crops as possible - all in order to claim the title of Most Valuable Cloud.&#10;&#10;Petrichor is a highly interactive board game, playable by 1-4 people (up to 5 with the expansion, see below). It&rsquo;s an action selection/area influence game, with 4 simple actions which interact with the various fields in ever surprising ways. The players move clouds with water droplets, and then rain those droplets onto specific fields, to make sure they have the right amount of water for the Harvest. During a Harvest, crops that have been watered enough are scored! Players are able to influence when, and how often the harvest happens. Players need to strike a fine balance between maintaining control of the different fields as well as influencing Harvest, to make sure the two come together at the optimal time.&#10;&#10;Solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MclM91c6yVVH_LWgcTvpIQ__original/img/PsGA30t4N1J_uUSu7pkKhDPzBLo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3673255.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MclM91c6yVVH_LWgcTvpIQ__thumb/img/1p1t5T0ff2chAvIOPcISVanqQs8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3673255.jpg@3@80@1@4
286@The Search for Planet X@At the edge of our solar system, a dark planet may lurk. In 2015, astronomers estimated a large distant planet could explain the unique orbits of dwarf planets and other objects. Since then, astronomers have been scanning the sky, hoping to find this planet.&#10;&#10;In The Search for Planet X, players take on the role of astronomers who use observations and logical deductions to search for this hypothetical planet. Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules.&#10;&#10;Each round, as the earth travels around the sun, players use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories, which is how players score points.&#10;&#10;As more and more objects are found, players narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points.&#10;&#10;The Search for Planet X captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzle-y nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process. Can you be the first to find Planet X?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NItjtztEUAKOpaTWZddu9A__original/img/fr-JmerGdiEj6r9UM7F6laogGF0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5744928.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NItjtztEUAKOpaTWZddu9A__thumb/img/x8YD4cAVOAbSDsZbmKgU0-WQ9wI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5744928.jpg@2.3613@60@1@4

288@Legends of Andor@Legends of Andor is a cooperative adventure board game for two to four players in which a band of heroes must work together to defend a fantasy realm from invading hordes. To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.&#10;&#10;At the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or &quot;Legend&quot;, a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.&#10;&#10;Will their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm?

Which landscapes, habitats, and species thrive will be up to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Ecos is simultaneous. Each round, one player reveals element tokens from the element bag, giving all players the opportunity to complete a card from their tableau and shape the continent to their own purpose. Elements that cannot be used can be converted into energy cubes or additional cards in hand or they can be added to your tableau to give you greater options as the game evolves.&#10;&#10;Mountain ranges, jungle, rivers, seas, islands and savanna, each with their own fauna, all lie within the scope of the players' options.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MyqAq5_DX27gVQE192gZ4g__original/img/R9jnDzY4JIxQ7H7hmTGr3rSBiAA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4720237.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MyqAq5_DX27gVQE192gZ4g__thumb/img/hu4Kc4DS5YZbywwQ_OjcbQD1iBs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4720237.png@2.6@75@2@6

291@Descent: Legends of the Dark@Terrinoth is in peril. The demon-tainted Uthuk Y'llan barbarians stalk the realm and the undead servants of Waiqar the Undying venture beyond their borders for the first time in memory. The leaders of Terrinoth are divided and fractious, unable to unite against these common threats. And in the northern barony of Forthyn, the stage is set for the next great confrontation between Terrinoth and the forces of darkness...&#10;&#10;For years, your journeys have taken you across the fantasy realm of Terrinoth, venturing into dark forests, shadowy cities, ancient crypts, and misty swamps &mdash; but your true legend is about to begin.&#10;&#10;Forge your own legend together with friends as you adventure across the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth in the co-operative dungeon-crawling board game Descent: Legends of the Dark. Powered by an integrated free companion app, Descent: Legends of the Dark puts you in the role of a budding hero with their own playstyle and abilities. Together with your unlikely companions, you'll begin an unexpected adventure &mdash; an adventure told across the sixteen quests of the &quot;Blood and Flame&quot; campaign. Throughout your campaign, you'll face undead lurking in the mists, demonic barbarians stalking the wilds, and even more terrifying threats. With 46 pieces of 3D terrain and forty hero and monster miniatures to draw you into the game, your greatest adventure is yet before you! Your objectives will change from quest to quest as you follow the overarching story of the campaign.&#10;&#10;Core gameplay mechanisms such as combat, fatigue, skills, items, and more have received completely new interpretations with Legends of the Dark, while a new approach to scenario layout and 3D terrain creates striking multi-level scenarios.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is fast and intuitive. You take three actions each turn: one maneuver action and two additional actions of your choice. Maneuvering gives you movement points, as shown in the upper right corner of the character sheet, and since you always have a maneuver action, you can reposition to put yourself in a more advantageous position for attack. Other than maneuvering, you can use an action to attack an enemy, rolling your attack dice and drawing upon your hero's abilities and weapons to deal maximum damage or inflict harmful conditions on your foes, or you may use the explore action to interact with a piece of 3D terrain or a token by using the app. You can also use your action to perform one of the most crucial actions in Legends of the Dark: the ready action, which lets you flip your hero sheet or one of your cards to its opposite side, unlocking new abilities!&#10;&#10;Your hero sheet isn't the only thing you can ready. Every hero also has an attack card and skill cards! Each hero starts the game with two weapon cards, which are sleeved together back-to-back to create a single attack card.  Skill cards can also be readied, switching between two complementary abilities.&#10;&#10;The app also brings new changes to gameplay, introducing enemies with adaptable strategies, complex status effects, and triggers fully managed by the app, and the ability to develop your heroes based on the choices you make in scenarios. You'll also uncover a wealth of activity between scenarios, such as crafting, shopping in the city, upgrading equipment, and more. Because of these various differences, Descent: Legends of the Dark is not compatible with Descent: Journeys in the Dark and its expansions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q96PxRVbrDxS9_4ZPTJtHQ__original/img/kGU8ligha3fyP0LuVTwmLMK9yEQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5941333.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q96PxRVbrDxS9_4ZPTJtHQ__thumb/img/hXnjkvD7KiLk2fon8tbvsXNtT_k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5941333.png@2.7143@180@1@4
292@Caverna: The Cave Farmers@Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&#10;&#10;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&#10;&#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rz22tqa5PCYvK9oDjIbvxg__original/img/h9il8XnFB0iqHNHsNTPNGxJZWdM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1790789.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rz22tqa5PCYvK9oDjIbvxg__thumb/img/3Ae-ieYpDv6w0vuNsGjOmXdcCrU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1790789.jpg@3.7829@210@1@7
293@Forbidden Island@Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&#10;&#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&#10;&#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JgAkEBUaiHOsOS94iRMs2w__original/img/H5d4I5z_HSpPEu7EAl0DqLt9_pM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic646458.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JgAkEBUaiHOsOS94iRMs2w__thumb/img/5aPR8-KMbgucI_XkPE2PJaMQQsg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic646458.jpg@1.7381@30@2@4
294@Bus@Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdUgrIW97AMy0X_ZAXKBIQ__original/img/xzDBpZR94KRpjiKJRW5ZqYWKmMo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4908538.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdUgrIW97AMy0X_ZAXKBIQ__thumb/img/4M7epe99tiI_bvQGRPMo7OvxSko=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4908538.jpg@3.0522@120@3@5
295@Yedo: Deluxe Master Set@The deluxe edition features:&#10;&#10;- Updated artwork&#10;- All components upgraded to true deluxe&#10;- You will be able to &quot;set up&rdquo; your own experience of YEDO. Whether you want no negative interaction or a game more punishing than ever before, you will be able to set up YEDO to suit your needs and pause play style.&#10;- New modular components brings a lot of interesting mechanisms into Yedo: the Tea house with a set of unique helpers who'll join you for a turn, Specialists in place of regular Disciples, new types of missions and much, much more!&#10;&#10;About the game:&#10;Japan, 1605 &ndash; Hidetada Tokugawa has succeeded his father as the new Shogun, ruling from the great city of Edo (a.k.a. Yedo), the city known in present times as Tokyo. This marks the beginning of the golden age of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the so-called Edo Period that will last until 1868. Naturally, the most powerful families in Edo immediately try to curry favor with the new Shogun &ndash; and this is the opportunity our clan has been looking for, our chance at power and glory. Our clan will prove ourselves to be indispensable to the new Shogun. We will work from the shadows to acquire information about our rival clans. We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat. We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us. We will find glory and honor in the eyes of this new Shogun &ndash; or failing that we will end his rule by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;In the strategy game Yedo, players assume the roles of Clan Elders in the city of Edo during the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions. To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience? You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants. It's all up to you &ndash; but be careful to make the right choices, for in Yedo, eternal glory and painful disgrace are two sides of the same coin&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xWiLk8PDqiLiDHQYteXQSQ__original/img/WDyiPfF2o3tGcRZqEdZL6ZKLMbU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6869289.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xWiLk8PDqiLiDHQYteXQSQ__thumb/img/Svbj9nFxHC_T6PiqWD9VWSOqGII=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6869289.jpg@3.2264@90@1@5

Grow your civilization, advance your culture and tech, and leave your mark by building wonders, with this edition of the game including fully-sculpted miniatures of the Seven Wonders.&#10;&#10;In Clash of Cultures, each player leads a civilization from a single settlement to a mighty empire.

298@The Great Wall@The Great Wall is a new asymmetric worker/soldier placement game with engine building themes and a twist in form of a constantly attacking AI (Mongolian Horde) that requires players to sometimes cooperate in order to defeat it. This is a new major board game from Awaken Realms.&#10;&#10;Players will control ancient clans in China trying to defend against invading Mongolian hordes and build a Great Wall. While every player will want to win (by earning VP = Honor) they also need to sometimes cooperate to defend against the hordes. Each clan will be asymmetric through its chosen Leader (resource production/starting resources/starting workers and units) and this asymmetry will increase as the game progresses (players will hire Advisors with unique skills, often creating unique engines).&#10;&#10;In The Great Wall, the players take the role of Generals defending the Wall against the Mongol Horde. The game is played over a series of turns called Years, each divided into 4 parts called Seasons.&#10;&#10;During Spring, new barbaric hordes invade the fields in front of the Great Wall and prepare to launch their assault. Summer is the time when generals prepare for the assault and mobilize their forces. During Fall, players take their turns, playing Command cards, resolving their effects and Activating Locations to gain various benefits. In Winter, the last layer of Defense is activated, then, the hordes try to assault the Walls.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, players will create their own unique engines based on their clan strength as well as interact with other players during all phases of the game, trying to get the most Honor points, which can be gained in a lot of different ways.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most Honor wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3P1cMmZ47nf_L1zLO-pKlg__original/img/8mgbSvzu7-1WX4R8ZRseupThtLY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5016682.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3P1cMmZ47nf_L1zLO-pKlg__thumb/img/TEMZ4S46PDoaI3X2enaNKKLthPE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5016682.jpg@3.7759@180@1@4
299@Unsettled@Lost amidst the surreal and bizarre unknowns of the far reaches of the cosmos, your crew of explorers must pull together to discover the resources necessary to survive the long journey home.&#10;&#10;Unsettled is a 2-4 player cooperative survival adventure set in the wondrous and unnerving fringes of uncharted space. There are no enemies and no combat, only an environment where every step, every breath, every particle around you could mean immediate, terrifying, death. Enemies are the least of your concerns.&#10;&#10;In these incredible conditions you must complete a series of tasks necessary to your continued survival. Perhaps the water reclamation system on the ship needs repair, or (as usual) food supplies are running low. Before you lies a strange alien landscape - it&rsquo;s up to you to complete these tasks using&hellip;whatever you find out there.&#10;&#10;Each time you play you will have a different combination of survival tasks to complete and the things you discover (and their weird properties) will be different as well. So while you always start out knowing what problems you need to solve you have no idea how you&rsquo;re going to use the world before you to do so (or what the world is going to do to you while you try).&#10;&#10;As you explore the environment, encountering wild &amp; unique opportunities along the way, you will work closely with the rest of your crew to achieve your goal of continued existence. The only thing you can be sure of is each other; lose that trust and you&rsquo;ll lose all hope of survival.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;This core set comes with 2 planets, Planet 001-Wenora and Planet 002-Grakkis, which are not available individually.&#10;&#10;Embrace your fungal hosts and discover mind-bending abilities beyond your imagination or be absorbed forever. Unsettled: Wenora is the 1st planet box for &quot;Unsettled&quot;.&#10;&#10;Wenora is a bizarre and wondrous fungal jungle teeming with alien vegetation and gargantuan spore-based lifeforms.&#10;&#10;Growth in this place is of a scale beyond any we've encountered. Life drips and pulsates disturbingly, mysterious pastes and powders covering most of the planet's crawling surfaces. Simply traversing the land is deeply unnerving, yet awe inspiring all the same. Tentacles, toxic spores and an alarming array of suction cups abound.&#10;&#10;Things you may find here:&#10;&#10;     Electromagnetic Polypores&#10;     Incandescent Slime&#10;     Floating Tentacle Knots&#10;     Screaming Glow Frogs&#10;     Telekinetic Microbe Clouds&#10;&#10;&#10;Discover pathways to the skies to escape violent storms and enormous creatures that haunt the surface. Unsettled: Grakkis is the 2nd planet box for &quot;Unsettled&quot;.&#10;&#10;Grakkis is a sand-swept desert ruins. What was once a massive planet-wide forest of unfathomably large trees is now that forest's graveyard - all the trees having long since petrified to a stone-like state. Some have crumbled into interesting formations. Some had rotted before petrifying, creating strange caves and crevices, many of them thousands of feet above ground. Colossal alien lifeforms, disturbing in their appearance, wander the wasteland. They tower horrifyingly in the distance like gods in some waking existential nightmare.&#10;&#10;Things you may find here:&#10;&#10;     Musical Stonewood Formation&#10;     Falling Stone-Fruit Bombs&#10;     Bioluminescent Paste&#10;     Blooming Geodes&#10;     Gaseous Sand Storms&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ldAjb0-puj6iiMZO0xuJtw__original/img/kkWT405tYN-PpRDL5oLjJVok19M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5106065.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ldAjb0-puj6iiMZO0xuJtw__thumb/img/KX2h7qhPJLV94t8vBkHUO1CjpOE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5106065.jpg@3.1667@90@2@4

You&rsquo;ll carefully plan your expansion to develop your production power and rule over this new world.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a Wonderful World is a cards drafting and engine building game from 1 to 5 players. Each round, players will draft 7 cards and then choose which ones will be recycled to immediately acquire Resources, and which ones will be kept for construction to produce Resources each round and/or gain victory points.&#10;&#10;When a card is fully built, it&rsquo;s added to the player&rsquo;s Empire to increase the player&rsquo;s production capacity for each round. The mechanical twist being that the production phase works in a specific order. You'll have to plan your constructions carefully!&#10;&#10;For a deeper insight of the gameplay, please follow this link : It's a Wonderful World - First steps&#10;&#10;In addition to the base game, players can also enjoy expansions boxes introducing an innovative Campaign mode. Each Campaign offers a storyline to follow and many gameplay twists.

301@Underwater Cities@In Underwater Cities, which takes about 30-45 minutes per player, players represent the most powerful brains in the world, brains nominated due to the overpopulation of Earth to establish the best and most livable underwater areas possible.&#10;&#10;The main principle of the game is card placement. Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's &quot;A-cards&quot;; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.&#10;&#10;All of the nearly 220 cards &mdash; whether special or basic &mdash; are divided into five types according to the way and time of use. Underwater areas are planned to be double-sided, giving players many opportunities to achieve VPs and finally win.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__original/img/1WL5-4DZi0hX76HEgsLIYRRaIh4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4837710.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__thumb/img/1gGYiRBx7W4wyLy826EHGTdjsKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4837710.png@3.6075@150@1@4
302@Jaipur@You are one of the two most powerful traders in the city of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, but that's not enough for you because only the merchant with two &quot;seals of excellence&quot; will have the privilege of being invited to the Maharaja's court. You are therefore going to have to do better than your direct competitor by buying, exchanging, and selling at better prices, all while keeping an eye on both your camel herds.&#10;&#10;Jaipur is a fast-paced card game, a blend of tactics, risk and luck. On your turn, you can either take or sell cards. If you take cards, you have to choose between taking all the camels, taking one card from the market, or swapping 2-5 cards between the market and your cards.&#10;&#10;If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good, and you receive as many chips for that good as the number of cards you sold. The chips' values decrease as the game progresses, so you'd better hurry! On the other hand, you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three, four, or five cards of the same good at a time, so you'd better wait!&#10;&#10;You can't sell camels, but they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_LTujSe_o16nvjDC-J0seA__original/img/zUnAdsgt4dCxvtoRDc_9DHbic0M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5100947.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_LTujSe_o16nvjDC-J0seA__thumb/img/82vhODfpxIT03BzW4NkisJ5Unzs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5100947.jpg@1.4737@30@2@2
303@Kanban: Driver's Edition@&quot;Kanban&quot; &mdash; or &#231;&#156;&#139;&#230;&#157;&#191;, the Japanese word for billboard &mdash; is a term for the visual cues that might be used in a lean, efficient assembly line in order to expedite and smooth workflow. These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.&#10;&#10;The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &mdash; failure &mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.&#10;&#10;Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.&#10;    Two independent player-influenced game timers &mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock &mdash; provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.&#10;    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.&#10;    A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.&#10;    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rzSmS-GD8_pGl9bWo07FWQ__original/img/TFtpuGRO0cbVjWl03YhtzTBRk5A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5638431.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rzSmS-GD8_pGl9bWo07FWQ__thumb/img/jo2betPcpo8mVZPIs993TT_nOMo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5638431.jpg@4.3631@120@2@4
304@BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat@In this introduction to the BattleTech game and universe, players each take control of one or more giant walking war machines (BattleMechs, aka 'Mechs) and battle until their opponent is destroyed or until the scenario objectives being played are completed.&#10;&#10;In 2019 the old BattleTech Introductory Box Set was replaced by two all-new box sets. The second of these (after the Beginner Box) is A Game of Armored Combat. AGoAC comes with eight 'Mech miniatures--seven new, one a repeat from the Beginner Box (all made to a higher quality level than the previous generation of box set miniatures). The AGoAC rules cover introductory weapons and construction technology, and the standard BattleTech ruleset for mechs.&#10;&#10;An expansion for this set, the BattleTech: Clan Invasion box set, adds more advanced technologies and introduces the Clan factions.&#10;&#10;In terms of rulebooks, the intended follow-on from this box is either the BattleMech Manual (for more advanced but still mech-only play) or Total Warfare (for combined arms play featuring mechs, combat vehicles, infantry, air support, etc).&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r1wbk3AK3J07jdb8n2pIDA__original/img/-Cfh41VKYNbV4asx73ZTjCx1nns=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4550063.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r1wbk3AK3J07jdb8n2pIDA__thumb/img/mybGIrjUjTQYvsii64H-2haPipA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4550063.png@3.6429@120@2@2

306@Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon@Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon  is an unforgettable, solo or cooperative adventure experience for 1-4 players. Blending Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology with a unique vision, it allows you to impact the game world in deep and meaningful ways. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike. Difficult decisions or harrowing choices wait behind every corner and seemingly minor tasks may reverberate with major long-term consequences.&#10;&#10;In a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by con&#239;&#172;&#130;ict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own. Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several con&#239;&#172;&#130;icting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to di&#239;&#172;&#128;erent deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.&#10;&#10;The character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need to brute force your way, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each con&#239;&#172;&#130;ict fun and exciting, while keeping you immersed in the game.&#10;&#10;In Avalon, there&rsquo;s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, the land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner. Many secrets can be discovered only after several games. Created by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aAwBzPzta4joKfFZt05hCw__original/img/e1HfD3XIvObNuGH6rq7kUSK-5aQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4385726.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aAwBzPzta4joKfFZt05hCw__thumb/img/zvV21ZaydrMSEbbYSNXcmw3WmfY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4385726.jpg@3.3003@120@1@4
307@Deus@In Deus, players work to develop their own civilizations in a shared environment. Each player starts the game with five building cards, and on a turn a player either uses one of these cards to construct a building or discard one or more cards to make an offering to a god. Cards come in six colors: red for military, green for resource production, blue for trade, brown for scoring, purple for temples, and yellow for a variety of effects.&#10;&#10;When you construct a building, you build it in the appropriate location on the modular game board &mdash; which is sized based on the number of players with the hexagonal tiles composed of seven landscape &quot;circles&quot; &mdash; then you place the card in your personal tableau in the appropriate stack of colored cards and activate the power of all of those cards already in your tableau, starting with the card at the bottom of the stack.&#10;&#10;When you make an offering, you discard cards, then receive the help of a god associated with one of the cards that you discarded, with the number of cards determining the strength of the associated action. You then refill your hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when all the barbarian villages on the game board have been surrounded and attacked or when all the temples have been constructed. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NOz3xJ-N5ptlq3rP9m5Wug__original/img/gtzP1OE-ifZdnSHoX1pmVwpF0mY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2219643.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NOz3xJ-N5ptlq3rP9m5Wug__thumb/img/nQQSc-beglCc9XQwvptEwgm07wU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2219643.png@2.843@90@2@4
308@Tobago@Tobago is an adventure game in which the players use representations of treasure maps to locate unknown treasures. During the game, more and more information about the location of a treasure is revealed and its possible locations are gradually narrowed down. When the location of one of the treasures is finally revealed players try to reach it as quickly as possible to secure the findings. The more clues you have provided, the more of a stake you will have in the loot.&#10;Players can carefully play their clues and use bonus-action gems to influence where and when the treasure is found in order to ensure a more favourable outcome when the loot is finally 'dug up' and shared.&#10;&#10;The game features a 3 piece, double-sided, modular game board which can be rearranged to create 32 possible island arrangements.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuC2C10_6QK84R45Mseojw__original/img/H3S1YSPe4O54yLV3W4G_zSTIiwU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic596625.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuC2C10_6QK84R45Mseojw__thumb/img/bfp4x8H9nzQJQyNf2amKyx1BqUs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic596625.jpg@2.1273@60@2@4
309@Stick 'Em@In the trick-taking card game Stick 'Em, first released as Sticheln, players seek to gather points each hand by taking as many cards as possible of all but one color, while trying to avoid cards of one color of their choosing.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the beginning of each hand, each player simultaneously selects and reveals one card from their hand, with the color of this card representing their &quot;pain&quot; color. At the end of the hand, each card of this color that they've collected (including their initial choice from their hand) is worth negative points equal to the card's face value. Each card of another color that this player has collected is worth 1 point.&#10;&#10;To play out the hand, the active player leads a card, then each other player in clockwise order plays one card. If all cards are of the same color, then whoever played the highest card collects these cards, then leads the next trick; if all cards are not of the same color, then whoever played the highest card of a color not initially led collects these cards, then leads the next trick. (One exception: A zero card can never win a trick.) In effect, each color played in a particular trick that doesn't match the color of the card led is considered a trump card, and the highest trump wins. In the event of a tie, the earlier played card breaks the tie.&#10;&#10;Play as many hands as the number of players in the game, summing each player's points over those hands to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Sticheln allow for play with up to six players, while the third and fourth German editions of the game include enough cards to allow for play with up to eight players. (These versions also allow players to play the game Hattrick by the same designer, with rules for this game included as a variant.)&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y9n_OHYdYjAZ4dEPadZ60w__original/img/zaPFle6nXVIoDXcDf2JXw4pwZ-E=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5282281.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y9n_OHYdYjAZ4dEPadZ60w__thumb/img/kxpD8JpCSzFVLr4SbWIXu-lW3Ls=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5282281.png@1.9203@60@3@8

312@Rolling Realms@In the early days of the coronavirus, a time of self-isolation for many people, Jamey decided to create an infinitely scaling roll-and-write game to teach and play with people around the world via Facebook Live.&#10;&#10;In Rolling Realms, players compete to earn the most stars in a series of minigames over 3 rounds. This is a roll-and-write game, meaning that players will write on the game components using dry-erase markers.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one player rolls 2 dice, and all players use the dice results on their realm cards to generate resources and earn stars. After 3 rounds, the player with the most stars wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5TZ5YfDo_r9vNNvWTl_pzw__original/img/YxcHzKCiiRq68K7Fd3qsUp-xhaE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6313647.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5TZ5YfDo_r9vNNvWTl_pzw__thumb/img/oKM1pAH4fCa7LCNluCqr9qNOq4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6313647.jpg@1.9385@30@1@6
313@One Deck Dungeon@One Deck Dungeon is a card game &quot;roguelike&quot; &mdash; a dungeon delve that is different every time, difficult to survive, with a character you build up from scratch. The deck consists of various foes to combat and other perils from the dungeon. Each card, though, depicts both the obstacle to overcome and the potential rewards for doing so. When you defeat a card, you claim it as either experience, an item, or a skill, tucking it under the appropriate side of your character card to show its benefits.&#10;&#10;The longer you take exploring the dungeon, the deeper you'll delve, and the difficulty will scale up quickly! If you make it far enough, you'll have to fight the dungeon boss. Survive, and you'll be a legend!&#10;&#10;One Deck Dungeon is designed for 1-2 players. With multiple sets, you can add more players.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/quvyGpE7kwbd2Mt1H5iLwQ__original/img/pjwQVzsCHiXg8qFTZpVoJYx6SOE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3019101.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/quvyGpE7kwbd2Mt1H5iLwQ__thumb/img/Vf5PvYElsfOG28LqJimwPC6rqw4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3019101.jpg@2.0465@45@1@2
314@Pandemic: The Cure@Pandemic: The Cure, a dice-based version of the popular Pandemic board game, sets up in less than a minute and plays in 30 minutes. As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it's up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities &mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, new &quot;infection dice&quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gCeKvj1ULixFOJ7uFawkcg__original/img/XeJ_F2OgSwwvTdEMsUiCAaatMb8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2225998.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gCeKvj1ULixFOJ7uFawkcg__thumb/img/xD_r6E6ZwYKXH-rtVPhGZoVleC4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2225998.jpg@2.0597@30@2@5
315@Thunderbolt Apache Leader@Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you in the cockpits of the world&rsquo;s best Close Air Support aircraft. In Thunderbolt-Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll zoom through canyons hunting enemy tanks and troops while dodging their AAA fire and SAMs.&#10;&#10;Stuffing all this heavy metal in one box has allowed us to expand the normal Leader component set! This game comes with 168 cards and 5 counter sheets!&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you down in the weeds in 8 campaigns spanning the globe. The game system creates immense replayability by pairing a Tactical Situation card with the Campaign card to create a unique environment for the campaign. This means that your campaign in North Korea might be part of a Holding Action, Show of Force, Rapid Deployment, or General War.&#10;&#10;The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world. The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces. If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridge-line to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react. Beware! During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&rsquo;re flying!&#10;&#10;You get to resolve every missile launched at enemy bandits, and every air to ground attack against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, S.P. Artillery, APC, Infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. You also get to resolve the enemy SAM, AAA, and Bandit attacks against your aircraft.&#10;&#10;While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy SAM and AAA assets?&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy tanks before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it won&rsquo;t be able to fly the next day.&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader or Phantom Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Thunderbolt-Apache Leader.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following aircraft:&#10;A-10A Thunderbolt II&#10;A-10C Thunderbolt II&#10;AH-64A Apache&#10;AH-64D Apache Longbow&#10;AH-1 Cobra&#10;F-16 Fighting Falcon&#10;AV-8B Harrier II&#10;AC-130 Spectre&#10;RQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;MQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;&#10;Scheduled Campaigns:&#10;Iraq 1991&#10;Pakistan 2013&#10;Libya 1984&#10;Iran 2014&#10;Taiwan Defense 2008&#10;North Korea 2011&#10;Israel Defense 2001&#10;North Atlantic WWIII 1986&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following weapons: Mk.82 Iron Bomb, Mk.83 Iron Bomb, AGM-65 Maverick, AIM-92 Stinger, LAU-68, LAU-61, ECM Pod, AGM-114 Hellfire, AIM-9 Sidewinder, Mk.20 Rockeye&#10;&#10;Target Audience: &#10;This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played co-op (like our other Leader games) by splitting-up the aircraft and planning/resolving missions as a team.&#10;&#10;Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each campaign consists of 2 to 6 turns in which you&rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each day.&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Thunderbolt/Apache Leader&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TmdTjsfF6hX8SL-h3cFTqA__original/img/NeVmFaA3OFqww6neH5juTEXb-nQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6291950.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TmdTjsfF6hX8SL-h3cFTqA__thumb/img/kRJxPt-2s3oONgjIktMx4GXrCzE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6291950.jpg@3.2222@90@1@1
316@Trickerion: Legends of Illusion@Trickerion is a competitive Euro-style strategy game set in a fictional world inspired by the late 19th century urban life and culture, spiced with a pinch of supernatural.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of rival stage illusionists, each with their own strengths and characteristics. They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.&#10;&#10;Using worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers &mdash; the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices &ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.&#10;&#10;The tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.&#10;&#10;The game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations. The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Dark Alley&quot; expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game. It also comes with 48 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 27 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gob752VqEklQFV_gz16hw__original/img/ivQUea2qrHp2TDLM4i7gp1123vQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2585510.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gob752VqEklQFV_gz16hw__thumb/img/C2GPhkDu7fWK6L64MTOaYVRCgS4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2585510.png@4.2365@180@2@4
317@Shogun@Japan during the Sengoku or &ldquo;Warring States&rdquo; Period (approx. 1467-1573): each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo, leading their troops to conquer the provinces of the Japanese islands.&#10;&#10;Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and score points.  Each round, the players decide which of their actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces.  If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cube Tower plays the leading role: cubes (representing troops) from both sides are thrown in together, and those that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points at the end of the game becomes &ndash; SHOGUN!&#10;&#10;Shogun is based on the Wallenstein game system. The game is an international edition with language-independent components and five language-dependent rule booklets.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Wallenstein&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6UzppDoJv9tKHQl-pWpIw__original/img/Yu1D0BNyavkX_SV8EK056FxfRsw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3336315.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6UzppDoJv9tKHQl-pWpIw__thumb/img/BcVo6uokndgMSoFdIdEmgu-2C1o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3336315.jpg@3.3688@120@3@5
318@Shards of Infinity@One-hundred years ago, The Infinity Engine was shattered and its reality-bending shards have destroyed most of the world. Now, it falls upon you to gather your forces, defeat your adversaries, and rebuild the Infinity Engine! Will you survive?&#10;&#10;Shards of Infinity combines an unprecedented level of strategy and customization into one small box. Rather than competing for points, players must outlast their opponents and reduce their health to zero, which can be done in a number of ways. Each player starts the game with a basic deck of cards, and they can acquire new cards from a central display of six cards (as in Ascension) and add these new cards to their deck or use them immediately, depending on what they are.&#10;&#10;Every character starts with fifty health and zero mastery. On each turn, you can spend one gem (a.k.a., money) to gain a mastery point. The more mastery you have, the more powerful your cards become. This lets even the weak cards in your starting deck become more powerful as the game progresses. If you reach a total of thirty mastery, you can activate your Infinity Shard, which instantly defeats your opponent.&#10;&#10;As you acquire new cards, you can employ allies and champions to craft your strategy. Mercenary cards can be added to your deck as in other deck-building games or they can be played immediately from the center row for their ability; this adds even more drama to each player's turn as a key mercenary flip can alter the very outcome of the game!&#10;&#10;Will you neutralize your opponents before they can fully master the Infinity Shard? With careful planning and aggressive gameplay, only one player can emerge the winner!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GfQBoqOl21zQx-Vy-dSHZw__original/img/OFsvutVOnXspJgkpSfw27Wx-AmA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4064509.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GfQBoqOl21zQx-Vy-dSHZw__thumb/img/YIrtck-_LqOn5Me4cbn8TWk-9UA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4064509.png@1.9848@30@2@4
319@Cryptid@You've studied the footage, connected the dots, and gathered what meager evidence you could. You're close &mdash; soon the whole world will know the truth behind the Cryptid. A group of like-minded cryptozoologists have come together to finally uncover the elusive creature, but the glory of discovery is too rich to share. Without giving away some of what you know you will never succeed in locating the beast, but reveal too much and your name will be long forgotten!&#10;&#10;Cryptid is a unique deduction game of honest misdirection in which players must try to uncover information about their opponents' clues while throwing them off the scent of their own. Each player holds one piece of evidence to help them find the creature, and on their turn they can try to gain more information from their opponents. Be warned; give too much away and your opponents might beat you to the mysterious animal and claim the glory for themselves!&#10;&#10;The game includes a modular board, five clue books, and a deck of set-up cards with hundreds of possible set-ups across two difficulty levels. It is also supported by an entirely optional digital companion, allowing for faster game set-up and a near-infinite range of puzzles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Note: some copies have a delta clue booklet with misprints in eight clues:&#10;&#10;    2,#9,#13,#64 states cougar, should be bear&#10;    3,#63,#72,#95 states bear, should be cougar&#10;&#10;&#10;The official website with an online tool to randomly generate more clues is http://playcryptid.com/&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qrPLpAnhFgc470ZRuXlvbg__original/img/QenUCVaFRry4-wlimHmeLn226Bo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4037705.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qrPLpAnhFgc470ZRuXlvbg__thumb/img/ZFL0o-lhnuWE21Sa9YS8qi8ayGU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4037705.jpg@2.2579@50@3@5
320@Bausack@Players take turns choosing blocks and giving them to each other to place on their structure.  A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):&#10;Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):&#10;There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4I1IqKLON-R1OO05erslkw__original/img/HeCCvzF2Q3VkVU6qBkT3XuZzZJ8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic306631.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4I1IqKLON-R1OO05erslkw__thumb/img/Mlouk44XJYEfufyt6rP25diSVlM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic306631.jpg@1.2935@45@2@8

Now you, as the prosecution or defense, must convince a nine-panel jury that Mary Surratt, one of eight people put on trial for conspiring to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln and other members of his cabinet, is guilty...or innocent.&#10;&#10;Unforgiven: The Lincoln Assassination Trial is a two-player game that takes place during the May 9 - June 28, 1865 trial of the first woman, Mary Surratt, ever to be executed for treason by the United States. The game begins amidst the chaos of Lincoln's assassination as the country struggles to heal over the wreckage of the American Civil War. Each player must persuade the jury to convict or acquit the accused and thereby win the game. To do so, players draft and play cards that help them strengthen their case with the jurors and recruit them to their side, while also finding overwhelming evidence for or against the accused.&#10;&#10;In one of the most high-profile trials in U.S. history, will Mary Surratt again face the hangman's noose of American justice &mdash; or can you stop the trap door from falling?&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9n7MQKUN9G5PMQzisZWm4g__original/img/rP9Yw-FGo4ODqVgvy_dwfTCX1MA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5860305.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9n7MQKUN9G5PMQzisZWm4g__thumb/img/M8SDex7WkYsuw-SCmOwQH_uMvKQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5860305.png@2.6@30@2@2
322@Claim@The King is dead! What happened? Nobody really knows, but he was found face down in a wine barrel this morning. It could have been either foul play or his own thirst that did him in. Regardless, the King is dead without any known heirs, so it's up to the five factions of the realm to decide who will be the new king: Will it be you or your opponent? Do you have what it takes to win over the realm's factions?&#10;&#10;Claim is played in two distinct phases. In phase one, each player gets a hand of cards that they use to recruit followers. In phase two, they use the followers from phase one to compete and win over the five factions of the realms. Each faction has a special power that affects play, and powers can be different in each phase! At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of followers of a faction wins that faction's vote, and whoever wins the vote of at least three factions wins the game!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XTnU0KdAC1l4WxxGr46F-g__original/img/HpGvBwJ-yjUkDT3Y0ZQuJgYY84s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3714302.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XTnU0KdAC1l4WxxGr46F-g__thumb/img/68PxtuISom2wysDawXSuHaIdT5U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3714302.jpg@1.6951@25@2@2
323@Village@Life in the village is hard &ndash; but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please. One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.&#10;&#10;Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.&#10;&#10;Village is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.&#10;&#10;Paraphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__original/img/HZYRVZoUtl7COYnS0NvXNSuaf80=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2760568.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__thumb/img/5H-bOQSAtO8LaWI3i3_oG3CQHHg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2760568.jpg@3.0714@90@2@4
324@Zombicide: Black Plague@Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Zombicide: Black Plague takes the zombie apocalypse into a fantastical medieval setting! The arcane powers of the Necromancers have unleashed a zombie invasion in the age of swords and sorcery, and it's up to your group of straggling survivors to not only stay alive during these dark times, but to take back the realm and punish those responsible for the apocalypse!&#10;&#10;Zombicide: Black Plague allows you take control of paladins, dwarves, knights, and magicians, wielding powerful swords, crossbows, and even magic spells to defeat the zombie hordes and its Necromancer overlords. The classic Zombicide rules have been revamped for this new incarnation of the game, while still retaining the nonstop action, tense atmosphere and easy-to-learn rules that made Zombicide a classic. Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead, pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments, or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire!&#10;&#10;Take on the zombie invasion from the medieval streets to secret vaults that create quick passages through the citadel (and often hold special artifacts). Chase down the elusive Necromancers to keep them from multiplying the zombie masses. And tackle a whole new set of missions through which your group of survivors will become the heroes of the land (or the last victims of the zombie massacre).&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kVHuMBxmathfnq42XINBQg__original/img/Xak18xf2xfSedYFS9-ZKwjSk7yc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2482309.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kVHuMBxmathfnq42XINBQg__thumb/img/u5Fuj4SwZhXElCO3VmrNKkAeXX4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2482309.jpg@2.4956@180@1@6
325@Escape from the Hidden Castle@Although billed as a children's game, Escape from the Hidden Castle, a.k.a. Midnight Party or Hugo, is actually quite enjoyable by adults as a light, fun game. Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;The Phantom (or &quot;Hugo the ghost&quot; in earlier versions) starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.&#10;&#10;Once the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra &quot;fright points&quot; from your score. As the Phantom catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught &quot;earns&quot; the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.&#10;&#10;Once all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied. After playing a predetermined number of rounds, the player with the fewest fright points wins!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mbZOI5Ke9pA0uKXXG6-Awg__original/img/IoT1AAHN1w08ZdagufrMIjCV9cU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3989540.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mbZOI5Ke9pA0uKXXG6-Awg__thumb/img/W3Vs0LlGQIvzaa8soiMaVWp3Ssw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3989540.png@1.1369@30@2@8

On top of that, Aliens compete for being the first to grab the souvenirs and fly back home, while each human wants to be the best at learning the Alien language!&#10;&#10;&laquo;First Contact&raquo; is perfect for associative-deductive games lovers.

327@Cyclades@In this latest collaboration between Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, players must buy the favor of the gods in their race to be the first player to build two cities in the Ancient Greek island group known as the Cyclades.&#10;&#10;Victory requires respect for all the gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one god, but must pay homage to each of five gods in turn.  Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the gods, as only one player can have the favor of each god per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single god per turn.&#10;&#10;     Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of Fortresses.&#10;     Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build Ports.&#10;     Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples.&#10;     Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities.&#10;     Apollo increases the income of his worshipers.&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QbaJOS8acWkJ6gSYI0KaQ__original/img/KOGjizqhVHXlKWxXkuyxkHRCNnA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic584779.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QbaJOS8acWkJ6gSYI0KaQ__thumb/img/YSxmsx_zxqdVoqNVGsNnAqyH1lc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic584779.jpg@2.819@90@2@5
328@Dogs of War@Dogs of War is an elegant game set in a steampunk-influenced renaissance universe. Noble houses engage each other in a series of fierce battles, and it's up to the players and the Dogs of War they control to deploy their private armies in support of whatever house they wish to favor. Clockwork knights and imposing war machines shift the tides of war as they enter the battlefields, but the interest of their Dog of War captains actually lie in the rewards offered by each noble house to its supporters. Each Dog of War has a special ability that helps them claim influence, win battles, or betray the house to which they've sworn allegiance!&#10;&#10;Dogs of War is not a game of pure military power, but rather a game in which deception and betrayal often lead the way to a decisive victory. The goal for the Dogs of War is to earn the most power by the end of the game. Thanks to thoughtful game design and development, there are many ways to achieve this, like defeating other captains in battle, getting rewards from the Houses you help, amassing gold and troops, and most importantly, gaining influence with the most successful Houses.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pN_2LoK9ICB6TD5h3QSPAQ__original/img/YC74jSe7Q6VSdSVxcBhdCKtqhwo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2682914.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pN_2LoK9ICB6TD5h3QSPAQ__thumb/img/5T3HgkcVHmIDMXEgEi42T_ZyJLg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2682914.jpg@2.6762@75@3@5
329@Egizia@The players are builders in Ancient Egypt, competing to get the most fame building different monuments requested by the Pharaoh (the Sphinx, the Obelisk, the Temple, and the Pyramid).&#10;&#10;The game lasts 5 turns. In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.&#10;&#10;In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &quot;pawns&quot; are placed, since &quot;workers&quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).&#10;&#10;When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).&#10;&#10;After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards. Whoever has the highest total is the winner.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lt07T2HIr_r7JerYdW0iyA__original/img/d8zivAydrkxYBwwXi1XeM73XlIU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1651950.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lt07T2HIr_r7JerYdW0iyA__thumb/img/sfnHUziRZl-kItnnr-QFfocySck=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1651950.jpg@2.8342@90@2@4
330@Paleo@Paleo is a co-operative adventure game set in the stone age, a game in which players try to keep the human beings in their care alive while completing missions. Sometimes you need a fur, sometimes a tent, but these are all minor quests compared to your long-term goal: Painting a woolly mammoth on the wall so that humans thousands of years later will know that you once existed. (Okay, you just think the mammoth painting looks cool. Preserving a record of your past existence is gravy.)&#10;&#10;What might keep you from painting that mammoth? Death, in all its many forms.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a couple of humans, who each have a skill and a number of life points. On a turn, each player chooses to go to one location &mdash; possibly of the same type as other players, although not the same location &mdash; and while you have some idea of what you might find there, you won't know for sure until you arrive, at which point you might acquire food or resources, or find what you need to craft a useful object, or discover that you can aide someone else in their project, or suffer a snakebite that brings you close to death. Life is full of both wonders and terrors...&#10;&#10;At the day's end, you need food for all the people in your party as well as various crafts or skills that allow you to complete quests. Failure to do so adds another skull on the tote board, and once you collect enough of those, you decide that living is for fools and give up the ghost, declaring that future humans can just admire someone else, for all you care.&#10;&#10;Paleo includes multiple modules that allow for a variety of people, locations, quests, and much more during your time in 10,000 BCE.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/85t1wkwgvh3d2mmjsRcDrw__original/img/ejYTb1MVpf9optjLWlwbYua0TMk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6039256.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/85t1wkwgvh3d2mmjsRcDrw__thumb/img/K1IMVdd39Or51HpLAfiXz3JNUvI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6039256.jpg@2.6085@60@1@4
331@Habitats@In Habitats, each player builds a big wildlife park without cages or fences. The animals in your park need their natural habitats: grassland, bush, rocks or lakes. The zebra needs a big area of grass and some water adjacent, for example, while a bat needs rocks and bush and water, a hart needs bush and grass, and a crocodile needs mainly water. There is a snake, baboon, bee, elephant, otter, lizard, turtle, eagle, meerkat, scorpio, hog, catfish, rhino, etc., each with its own landscape requirements &mdash; 68 different animals in total.&#10;&#10;Each player starts their individual park with an entrance tile, and they are each represented in the marketplace of animal tiles by a ceramic figure (or a wooden ranger meeple in some editions). On a turn, a player takes the tile to their left, right or front; moves their figure to the space just vacated; then draws a tile to place where their figure started the turn.&#10;&#10;When adding an animal tile in your park, you add its main landscape &mdash; the base space for the animal &mdash; to your park, too. While placing this new animal, its own piece of landscape can help to fulfill the requirements of your other animals' requirements, e.g., the water on a hippo tile fulfilling the adjacent otter's need for water. Thus, fulfilling every animal's desire for land becomes a more and more difficult task with each tile you add.&#10;&#10;Aside from expanding your park with different landscape types, flora and animals, you can improve its profitability by building extra entrance roads, trek spots, and watchtowers.&#10;&#10;Habitats lasts three seasons, with each season giving each player 6-9 new tiles for their parks. Whoever has best met the goal of the season receives bonus points, with a smaller number of points for second and third place. At the end of the game, each player scores for each tile in their park based on whether that tile's requirements are satisfied. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;NOTE: BoardGameTables edition contains both XL Expansion and Double Expansion and is entirely replacing the previous editions.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-BF0wkdHwcEyfw_Un48d2g__original/img/TQUEKGXDST8fNc2AOLof3-_9Es4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6744098.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-BF0wkdHwcEyfw_Un48d2g__thumb/img/nmcZVe-7THsTaUlMCeiemofSqwY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6744098.jpg@2.24@50@2@5

Gather heroes and powerful artifacts, please the gods and bear their power to write your own epic tale.&#10;&#10;Let your allies achieve their destiny and enter the Elysium, home of the glorious and the brave. Once the stories are written, only one demigod will be chosen to stand at the side of Zeus.&#10;&#10;Elysium is a game of set collecting and combinations in which players recruit cards representing heroes, items, powers and gods. These cards have many different powers and you can create powerful combination to earn gold (the help of the gods) and victory points (the favor of the gods). Each card belongs to one of the eight Olympians gods (a family), and shows a level (1 to 3).&#10;&#10;During the five turns of the game, players will try to transfer their cards to the Elysium and write their own Legends, which are series of cards from the same family or from different families of the same level. The more epic the Legends, the more favor from the gods they&rsquo;ll earn. But as they go to Elysium, most cards lose their power and players will therefore have to renounce some of their combinations !&#10;&#10;A game of balance and opportunity with  simple action, but constant dilemmas and complex strategies.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hNyO7u1pR3oSxKTELS7n2w__original/img/rpASlZTyhc7GMnGiMwk1i4AC-PY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2837103.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hNyO7u1pR3oSxKTELS7n2w__thumb/img/HWVlTW4WTam1F8UeT6RJeS4olIs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2837103.png@2.7618@60@2@4

For over one hundred and fifty years Britain and France were locked in a struggle for domination of North America. Thousands of miles from their homes, settlers and soldiers were faced with impenetrable forests, unpredictable American tribes, and formidable distances.

A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player game that allows you to recreate this contest. You can change the course of history by your decisions.&#10;&#10;A Few Acres of Snow takes an innovative approach to the subject, using cards to represent locations and manpower.

Join forces to fend off Viking invaders, build monasteries to extend your influence, and gather support in towns and villages throughout the land. To become High King of all Ireland, you need to navigate a web of shifting alliances, outmaneuver your enemies, and grab history by the reins.&#10;&#10;The success of the historical Brian Boru rested on three pillars: his victories against the Vikings, the favor he managed to garner with the Church, and the alliances he forged through political marriages. This became the foundation of the game, with each pillar becoming a suit in the trick-taking that forms the core of the mechanisms. Win a trick and you gain influence in a town, which, in turn, gains you majorities in the regions; if you lose the trick, however (deliberately or otherwise), you instead take an action corresponding to the suit of the card.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S-Ro5X2B6x2V6bana2f0fA__original/img/m09hR2xEAKWjfYuJge5vWOnqJCA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6149105.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S-Ro5X2B6x2V6bana2f0fA__thumb/img/vMUxc-cwNH-PMKaDgWx0HAjJFDQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6149105.jpg@2.4333@90@3@5

339@Arboretum@Arboretum is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, aged 10 and up, that combines set collection, tile-laying and hand management while playing in about 25 minutes. Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.&#10;&#10;The deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__original/img/RMi0pEsP8agfH-tgYkeRGilD3oo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4172124.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__thumb/img/X6V1M2nZOinTgwE0KIBfup_QrCw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4172124.png@2.1431@30@2@4

341@Android@From the publisher: Android is a board game of murder and conspiracy set in a dystopian future. Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android&rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she&rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you&rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons.&#10;&#10;During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties.&#10;&#10;The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed. At that point, victory points are awarded based on the aforementioned sectors. The player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gm1pY1yQzd_9VNDcZzQIxQ__original/img/ZHYRcxEWQ6aRLQtuWyZlAdNQ1b8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic400196.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gm1pY1yQzd_9VNDcZzQIxQ__thumb/img/sgDeJwgPrrNKpaE2koz0xHiJ134=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic400196.jpg@3.9679@180@3@5

As a Battle Wizard, you'll put together up to three spell components to craft millions (okay, not really) of spell combos.

343@Anomia@Anomia plays off the fact that our minds are positively brimming with all sorts of random information: things to eat, pop songs, websites, etc... Sure, under normal circumstances, it's easy to give an example of a frozen food or a dog breed, but you'll find that your brain works a little differently under pressure!&#10;&#10;To play, draw and reveal a card from the center pile. Does the symbol on your card match one on another player's card? If so, you must quickly face-off with the other player by giving an example of the person, place, or thing on their card before they can do the same for yours. If you blurt out a correct answer first, you win their card and the drawing continues.&#10;&#10;Sounds simple, right? Wrong! Wild cards allow non-matching symbols to match, increasing the number of things to which you must pay attention. Cascading face-offs can occur when you hand over a lost card, thereby revealing a new top card on your play pile.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OvOpd-Lhl7t3h9fF_qi6lQ__original/img/0_8ukg1eYy8HxXTAwPgKptJXTeU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2527529.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OvOpd-Lhl7t3h9fF_qi6lQ__thumb/img/002NO49Pl3-9dPUj43StWt0SS2c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2527529.jpg@1.0469@30@3@6

347@Smartphone Inc.@In Smartphone Inc., you become a CEO of one of the largest smartphone-producing companies in the time when smartphones were only beginning to conquer the world. Research technologies, develop your factory, build your worldwide office network, and outprice your competitors to become the most profitable and successful smartphone company in the world.&#10;&#10;Smartphone Inc. is an economic simulation Eurogame. Over five rounds, players program their decisions about price, production, research, and expansion. The game features a unique mechanism of planning, which combines patching mechanisms with bidding and action selection. Each of the rounds consists of eight simple phases: planning, pricing, production, development, research, expansion, selling, and profits.&#10;&#10;In the planning phase, all players simultaneously make decisions for the next year by overlaying (&quot;patching&quot;) their two plan cards and all of their development tiles. The actions they plan on their cards and tiles in this phase will determine what actions they can perform during all of the later phases.&#10;&#10;In the pricing phase, players change the price they charge for their smartphones based on their plan. A lower price helps to go earlier and sell more smartphones on the market, but a higher price, while risky, helps players to earn more money.&#10;&#10;In production, all players produce smartphones.&#10;&#10;In development, players take development tiles, which expand their planning possibilities in future rounds.&#10;&#10;In research, players discover new technologies. Each technology not only expands players' ability to sell smartphones to customers, but also gives them special powers they can use during the game.&#10;&#10;In the expansion phase, players open offices in neighbor regions, which allow them to sell in that region and develop their network of offices to more regions in further turns.&#10;&#10;In the sale phase, players sell the phones they produced in regions where they have offices. But there is limited space in each region - and if your price is too high, cheaper rivals can block you from selling.&#10;&#10;In the profit phase, players get income for their sales. Players gain the sale prices for all of their sold smartphones, and the player who sold the most phones in each region gains a bonus for controlling the accessory market. At the end of this phase all sold smartphones are discarded from the map - and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the richest player wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ndctxvd7kBXYubeYRKRqzw__original/img/gGL8Fh-pFgTqB3lF-47ClLYLu8s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4258616.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ndctxvd7kBXYubeYRKRqzw__thumb/img/hJtPqShJYdb8DsdnTvpdkXrx-CU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4258616.jpg@2.748@90@1@5
348@Love Letter@The noble Princess is looking for an ideal partner and confidant to help with her royal duties when she one day assumes the throne. You must prove your worth and gain her trust by enlisting allies, friends, and family of the Princess to carry a letter of intent to her. Can you earn the Princess' trust and become her confidant?&#10;&#10;Playing cards one at a time, players in Love Letter use the abilities of these key people in the Princess' life to outwit their opponents and successfully deliver their letter and gain her favor. Players must utilize each character's special skill to avoid being caught and successfully deliver their letter to the Princess. Once a set number of favor tokens are acquired, that player wins and becomes the Princess' confidant.&#10;&#10;This 2019 edition of Love Letter features new artwork by Citadels artist Andrew Bosley, screen-printed tokens, and two new characters (five cards in total) that allow for games with up to six players. When played, the Chancellor (value 6) allows you to draw two new cards, add those to your hand, then place two cards of your choice on the bottom of the deck.

350@Evolution@In Evolution, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk.  Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.&#10;&#10;Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules.  The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.  Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.  Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.  Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.  And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.  So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.&#10;&#10;&quot;The theme of evolution is not just tacked on: it drives play.&quot; - Nature (the world's most prestigious scientific journal)  &#10;Evolution was covered in the journal Nature.  The article was written by Stuart West, a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Oxford who has used Evolution in his undergraduate class.  &#10;&#10;     https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1487263/evolution-and-other-evolution-themed-games-nature&#10;     https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1580710/using-game-evolution-teach-evolution&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wo_EYno7S66psGPMl_JtiQ__original/img/buKqUQr48Cb41noIhoaAJzWBLQA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3543505.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wo_EYno7S66psGPMl_JtiQ__thumb/img/_30uXRkyUuk9vMeeedlSqQ3oJwA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3543505.jpg@2.4298@60@2@6

352@In the Hall of the Mountain King@Play as trolls rebuilding your abandoned kingdom under the mountain in In the Hall of the Mountain King. With muscle and magic, you'll unearth riches, dig out collapsed tunnels, and carve out great halls as you raise the toppled statues of your ancestors to their places of honor at the heart of the mountain. Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system. Timing and tactics are key as you work to restore your home to its former glory and win the crown!&#10;&#10;Working on the same game board with the other players (but beginning at your own entrance), you'll dig a competing network of tunnels by spending increasingly valuable materials to lay polyomino tiles onto the map. You want to extend your tunnels to connect with buried gold and materials, with workshop locations that can transform resources, and especially with toppled statues. Statues are key to scoring, and you'll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain.&#10;&#10;A major aspect of the game is the cascading production. You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources &mdash; gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers &mdash; that it produces. When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a &quot;pyramid&quot;. The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry. In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears. The timing of your hiring turns versus your building turns is important as you try to maximize your cascades while making sure you get the trolls you want from the shared market and also stay competitive on the map.&#10;&#10;The game ends shortly after the last player hires their sixth troll, then the player with the most honor (earned for digging tunnels of increasing quality, for excavating great halls, and for moving statues closer to the heart of the mountain, especially onto matching pedestals) is crowned the Mountain King and wins!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O85rGsVqqTfrFbcHQCIFHg__original/img/DhTYEiUShjAY599TQ9yQaJxpu9I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4421569.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O85rGsVqqTfrFbcHQCIFHg__thumb/img/td7Xjx0NMeSUrBVm4fBoIweCxjA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4421569.jpg@2.8082@90@2@5
353@Notre Dame@Rio Grande Games' description:&#10;&#10;The players take on the roles of the heads of influential families in Paris at the end of the 14th century. In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3&ndash;5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of his family, each player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most prestige at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players play as well-off Parisians in the 14th century who wish to improve the importance and appearance of the city quarter around the famous Notre Dame cathedral. The primary game concept is original, but simple, card play players use to permanently improve their influence in the quarter. However, turn after turn, round after round, players must make choices that can have major implications. If one does one thing, then the other can't be done. Concentrating on one aspect means automatically ignoring another, which, above all others, is particularly dangerous in the case of the gradually approaching plague...&#10;&#10;After 9 exciting rounds and about 75 action-filled minutes, Notre Dame is over.

354@Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun@Four millennia ago on the eastern bank of the Nile river was laid the foundation of the Temple of Amun-Ra. Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as &quot;The Most Select of Places&quot; (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.&#10;&#10;Join ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.&#10;&#10;The game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over multiple rounds. Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.&#10;&#10;As you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice &mdash; if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section &mdash; but also which value die to draft. You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order.&#10;&#10;When you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from. Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris. Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!&#10;&#10;Two scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources. However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CBLtzgG8zsqDkUZ_hN5-ew__original/img/jEL4WHl98vZHaZFcw9hDXxsxjSo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5313583.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CBLtzgG8zsqDkUZ_hN5-ew__thumb/img/QaUXxrgmXFrlNADgPeGhY5F538g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5313583.jpg@4.0804@120@1@4
355@Dojo Kun@In a mystical land, far away from here, two prestigious martial arts tournament have been held since the ancient times: the White Lotus Tournament and the Black Lotus Tournament. These two tournaments are the most important show of legendary martial arts used by powerful athletes. Extraordinary masters are always looking for new talented athletes that will be forged into the ideal of the Perfect Warrior by exhausting training and life experiences that will fortify body, mind and soul.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dojo Kun&quot; means &quot;Dojo Rules&quot; and is a set of principles that guide the physical and spiritual development of the martial art practitioners. Dojo Kun is a game in which each player heads one of the four dojo (Tiger, Crane, Bear, Cobra). The main goal is to train your athletes and attract new ones, buy new training machines, expand your dojo, find adventures, and eventually lead your athletes into winning the martial arts tournament.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into two seasons. During each season there are three preparation turns based on worker placement mechanics in which you will manage your dojo and train your athletes.&#10;&#10;During the season, the athletes can also learn special techniques by visiting one of the ancient masters hidden in the central part of the board. Each season ends with the martial arts tournament, where each dojo can send up to two athletes. In case of empty slots in the tournament, athletes from the fifth dojo (the Skull Dojo) will attend. (These athletes are managed by the game and can even win the tournament!)&#10;&#10;Combat between athletes is simulated by throwing a set of custom dice. There are four different dice, one for each fighting technique. Players will roll dice according their athlete's experience level (Dan): the higher the Dan, the higher the chance of winning the match! Before a fight, the players that are not attending can predict the winner of that fight to gain prestige.&#10;&#10;The tournament ends with the grand final in which a new champion will be crowned. At the end of the second season the Dojo with most Prestige Points will win the game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c_xON2ilw14BAiYykhdKXQ__original/img/1ITrSXYed_GLhEMiLl6Ih2ytNW0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3639331.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c_xON2ilw14BAiYykhdKXQ__thumb/img/2bS05pKxzAG9kpZjk4ztNi4wxQs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3639331.jpg@2.6964@90@1@4
356@Detective: City of Angels@Detective: City of Angels, set in the dark and violent world of 1940s Los Angeles, is a game of mystery, deception, and investigation for 1&ndash;5 players. Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies.&#10;&#10;Detective: CoA uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O'Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy's Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they're wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve.&#10;&#10;Detective: CoA includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and &quot;hot&quot; leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience.&#10;&#10;Inspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a murder-mystery game unlike any other. Will one detective rise above the rest and close the case on L.A.'s latest high profile murder? Or will The Chisel sow enough doubt and confusion to prevent the detectives from solving the crime?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;A &quot;sleuth&quot; mode allows 1 or more players to play fully cooperatively, solving the cases together.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xWdK1lL-2ZTdzBZGYjjqkw__original/img/952nbRCH-EE0TtcMD_Cpol0tRXQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3469246.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xWdK1lL-2ZTdzBZGYjjqkw__thumb/img/wl_YxOhd-S6QbpyHAQZGhV109rw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3469246.jpg@2.3@150@1@5
357@Chronicles of Crime@Chronicles of Crime is a cooperative game of crime investigation, mixing an app, a board game and a touch of Virtual Reality.&#10;&#10;With the same physical components (board, locations, characters and items), players will be able to play plenty of different scenarios and solve as many different crime stories.&#10;&#10;Players start the app, choose the scenario they want to play, and follow the story. The goal being to catch the killer of the current case in the shortest time possible.&#10;&#10;Using the Scan&amp;Play technology, each component (locations, characters, items, etc.) has a unique QR code, which, depending on the scenario selected, will activate and trigger different clues and stories. That means players will be able to get new stories way after the game is released simply by downloading the app's updates, without any shipping of new physical components involved.&#10;&#10;The VR experience only requires a mobile phone. Players simply put the VR glasses (optional buy) onto their mobile device, and put the VR glasses on their nose, holding their mobile device in front of their eyes, to immerse themselves in the game's universe and search for clues in a virtual world.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 1 tutorial and 5 scenarios, but more can be downloaded directly inside the app!&#10;Each session last around 1h to 1h30 minutes and many scenarios are connected to each others in order to tell a much bigger story.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1BMyuEwK0zV9005oYinYLw__original/img/3OigysLof9HIk4jvV79Cm-tb-gY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4317519.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1BMyuEwK0zV9005oYinYLw__thumb/img/QFzbDlFGzK3yRZNLnRr4YzHwEuY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4317519.jpg@2.0871@90@1@4
358@Titan@This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore.  The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.&#10;&#10;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MxQroqFDoQAV4s2oyYnyWQ__original/img/prIQozvI371DWiib_dN9WWqLcCk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1083237.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MxQroqFDoQAV4s2oyYnyWQ__thumb/img/dUjeyKSqzgcRd2NaU1Fy8lnEjlw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1083237.jpg@3.4612@240@2@6
359@Glory to Rome@In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&#10;&#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&#10;&#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.  Many of the non-English editions use more conventional artwork.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S_-n-WRvpzgH-d8xuzJgmg__original/img/cvWVDcSUBsngibbELMhABgIyrVo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1079512.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S_-n-WRvpzgH-d8xuzJgmg__thumb/img/2KvAr_TOIvW-9DNxlX-KuyL0Fwo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1079512.png@2.9251@60@2@5
360@51st State: Master Set@The world you know no longer exists. There is no government. No army. No civilization. The United States has collapsed, and now thirty years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control over the ruined country, try to establish a new order, try to control others and create a new country, a new state: the 51st State.&#10;&#10;51st State is a card game in which players control one of four powers trying to build a new country. Players put new locations into play, hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills. To do this, every card in 51st State can be used in three different ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Raze a location to gain many resources once.&#10;    Deal with this location to gain one resource every turn.&#10;    Build the location so that you can use its skill each turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;51st State: Master Set marks the rebirth of the 51st State line, with this set containing 88 cards from the original base game, and 50 cards each from both the New Era and Winter expansions; one of these expansions can be mixed with the cards of the base game, but not both at the same time. The entire set has been rebalanced to offer a cohesive experience no matter which expansion you choose to use.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oaDIooAl30NgVUWeIpC1sg__original/img/7jICcOLqm0LTdlXVUOUJloyqj2A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2945432.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oaDIooAl30NgVUWeIpC1sg__thumb/img/bWWziWTy6KflOseb2tYLNC0PrfQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2945432.jpg@2.9091@90@1@4
361@Lewis & Clark: The Expedition@On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers &ndash; Meriwether Lewis and William Clark &ndash; to discover this huge terra incognita.&#10;&#10;Lewis &amp; Clark is a board game in which each player manages an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.&#10;&#10;Lewis &amp; Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new &quot;handbuilding&quot; mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.&#10;&#10;Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IiJ1JK6AjlSCKsC8U_DqMw__original/img/4W8ffc5xOvC6sl660XMGCBqkzJ8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5375937.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IiJ1JK6AjlSCKsC8U_DqMw__thumb/img/sRsfWxhyB9hPjkFVSE1y_W_AiP8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375937.jpg@3.3352@120@1@5
362@Council of 4@The Empire, formed by three Kingdoms, lives in an era of wealth and prosperity. Each Kingdom is governed by a council of four nobles. The members of six influential families sit around in the councils and lead the Kingdoms.&#10;&#10;The players hold the roles of rich merchants who seek to obtain permits to build their own Emporium inside the cities of the three Kingdoms. Whoever takes more permits, while also opening their Emporium in the best place, will be the most famous merchant and will win the game. But pay attention to the Emperor! He can be your ally and allow you to build without permits!&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can perform different actions:&#10;&#10;- The main action is to corrupt a council, which is represented by a slide with four pawns representing four nobles. By corrupting the three councilors of the three Kingdoms, the player gets permit cards that give various instant and endgame benefits, and the possibility to build an Emporium in a specific city.&#10;&#10;- Another action is to play a permission card to build an Emporium. Each Emporium earns the player the special benefits of the space where it's built, but also activates all connected emporiums in a chain effect.&#10;&#10;- Corrupt the Emperor&rsquo;s council to allow a player to build Emporiums without permission cards.&#10;&#10;- Players can change the composition of a council.&#10;There are many different ways to earn points:&#10;&#10;- Build a connected Emporium in the cities that award points.&#10;&#10;- Build your emporium in all the cities of an area of the board: the faster you complete the area, the more points you earn.&#10;&#10;- Move up on the nobility&rsquo;s track.&#10;&#10;Obtain permits that give points.&#10;Moreover, the board is modular and has eight possible combinations.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1PVwotn_MXzaG8aRWJBwLw__original/img/FS68rLI2D1N9rWwC-L8Iijx_6Ck=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3252438.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1PVwotn_MXzaG8aRWJBwLw__thumb/img/F8oR7WY_sXDfNAJKVmenGWQweQs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3252438.png@2.5909@75@2@4
363@Samurai@Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &quot;non-majority&quot; symbols each player has collected.&#10;&#10;The game is part of what is sometimes called the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o9-sNXmFS_TLAb7ZlZ4dRA__original/img/TPKZgpNxB_C73RNbhKyP6UR76X0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3211873.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o9-sNXmFS_TLAb7ZlZ4dRA__thumb/img/22MSUC0-ZWgwzhi_VKIbENJik1w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3211873.jpg@2.4813@60@2@4
364@Tiny Towns@You are the mayor of a tiny town in the forest in which the smaller creatures of the woods have created a civilization hidden away from predators. This new land is small and the resources are scarce, so you take what you can get and never say no to building materials. Cleverly plan and construct a thriving town, and don't let it fill up with wasted resources! Whoever builds the most prosperous tiny town wins!&#10;&#10;In Tiny Towns, your town is represented by a 4x4 grid on which you will place resource cubes in specific layouts to construct buildings. Each building scores victory points (VPs) in a unique way. When no player can place any more resources or construct any buildings, the game ends, and any squares without a building are worth -1 VP. The player with the most VP wins!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aE1EoOzr530gQin8bj8QDA__original/img/-GDAsvmQ3wkuHaZ8h9G5Gk_nvVA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4460401.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aE1EoOzr530gQin8bj8QDA__thumb/img/AI-Ro3wLJtpyZLmCMNywOlpz0S8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4460401.jpg@2.045@60@1@6
365@Medina (Second Edition)@The year is 1822. After years of decay, it is time to rebuild the medina, located at the foot of the Atlas mountains. The architects and engineers of the city work to erect large and beautiful palaces and to renovate the damaged city wall. As the reconstruction of the old city progresses, the city's inhabitants flock through the alleys, and the contours of the new city gradually reappear!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players must place two pieces on the board (except when allowed to skip this with a tea tile), either augmenting an existing building (or starting a new building if the current building of that color is finished), or expanding one of the other features of the city, like the market or the walls. Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to the building.&#10;&#10;Also, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a bonus for that color. Finally, there are bonuses for palaces around the well, as well as for the player who most recently connected one of their buildings to the walls, which grow from the four corners of the city.&#10;&#10;Medina is a tense game by the great designer Stefan Dorra. This latest edition of the game features a double-sided game board (enabling a two-player game), almost 200 detailed wooden pieces, and updated gameplay, as well as rules and components never before published for this game!&#10;&#10;See Medina for the original edition of this game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AXQPpIEYd6uCDOm6xkW2Rg__original/img/FPcoYGcCy_3TXXpsghHe8iUyut8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2061270.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AXQPpIEYd6uCDOm6xkW2Rg__thumb/img/oV9RstPE83y1Aug6kwUk-cn4VEY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2061270.jpg@2.3594@60@2@4
366@Penguin Party@After a long dark winter, the sun is shining and it's party time for the penguins, who celebrate by fishing. To look over the waters more easily, the penguins build high pyramids. The more penguins you can fit in the pyramid, the better &mdash; but it's not that easy.&#10;&#10;In Penguin Party, players collectively build a pyramid of penguins, trying to empty their hands of cards along the way. The deck consists of 36 penguin cards: 8 green and 7 each of red, blue, yellow, and purple. Deal the deck out as evenly as possible, with the final card in a five-player game starting as the first card in the base of the pyramid.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either play a card to the left or right of the base of the pyramid, which can be at most eight cards wide, or play a card on a higher level of the pyramid so long as it's supported by two penguins, at least one of which is the same color as the card being played. If you cannot play a card, discard your hand face down and take as many penalty markers as the number of cards you didn't play. If you empty your hand, you can return two penalty markers previously collected to the supply.&#10;&#10;Play as many rounds as the number of players, with each player starting one of the rounds. Whoever has the fewest penalty markers at the end of the game wins. (With two players, deal each player 14 cards, remove the other cards from play without looking at them, and build a pyramid with a base only seven cards wide.)&#10;&#10;Admin note: This game looks very similar to Penguin, but differs not only in components (being a card game while Penguin has 3D penguin tokens), but also in the number of colors and distribution. Penguin has four colors with nine pieces each, while this game has five colors with a distribution of 4x7 + 1x8.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kZFrnOtLbeIztlI1RrD51w__original/img/F5Je4dOjkf_8rlE4Q98-fF146Uk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7078447.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kZFrnOtLbeIztlI1RrD51w__thumb/img/xfKHgZT98Sdqfd7YWNSWIpjUAg8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7078447.png@1.1375@15@2@6

368@Tokyo Highway@Note: This is for the 4-player version of Tokyo Highway. For the two player version, please go here: Tokyo Highway&#10;&#10;In Tokyo Highway, players compete to place all of their cars on the road first &mdash; but to do that they have to build the roadways so that they have somewhere for their cars to go!&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players construct columns of varying heights by using the 88 squat gray and yellow pillars in the box, then connect those columns with sticks that serve as roadways, with the column you create usually not being the same height as the one it's connected to. When you place a highway that passes under or over an existing highway, you get to (carefully!) place a car on that highway. Place a highway that both goes over and under other highways, and you can place two cars!&#10;&#10;The yellow cylinders allow you to create a column the same height as another while also allowing you to fork the roadway to create more twists and turns.&#10;&#10;The first player to place all ten of their cars &mdash; with or without using tweezers &mdash; wins!&#10;&#10;This version of Tokyo Highway includes both the original base game and the expansion that allows for games with up to four players &mdash; not to mention four buildings that give additional obstacles while trying to lay down the concrete.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fV_nbXzF2NEcCpDbyIfkBg__original/img/qdgyMhDfwNN9bkDry76Juv-5_pk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4331609.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fV_nbXzF2NEcCpDbyIfkBg__thumb/img/5CImncZI1a3Ost0FQl23lEXy6Gc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4331609.jpg@1.3871@50@2@4
369@Railways of the World@Railways of the World (2009) is the new edition of the base game for Eagle Games' popular Railways of the World series, first published as Railroad Tycoon in 2005.  It reimplements the original game with several improvements.&#10;&#10;Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon &quot;mission&quot; card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!&#10;&#10;Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available.  Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.&#10;&#10;This game is preceded by the designer's other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas.  Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.&#10;&#10;A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.&#10;&#10;Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game&#10;&#10;Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;     Steam&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sz0wLg3TgycpzSvSMdzRJA__original/img/vi7OckGr7HWbTGOkEyxgcCUIfiU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3869603.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sz0wLg3TgycpzSvSMdzRJA__thumb/img/lfoHFV0OafSO8boxKEX8V3Tq5TM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3869603.jpg@3.0183@120@2@6
370@Unearth@Long ago, your ancestors built great cities across the world. Now your tribe must explore forests, deserts, islands, mountains, and caverns to find these lost cities. Claim the ruins, build places of power, and restore the glory of a bygone age.&#10;&#10;Unearth is a bend-your-luck game of dice placement and set collection. Designed by Jason Harner and Matthew Ransom, it plays in under an hour with 2-4 players. Each player leads a tribe of Delvers, represented by five dice (3 six-sided, 1 four-sided, and 1 eight-sided). Players take turns rolling and placing dice in an attempt to claim Ruins.&#10;&#10;The game's elegant core mechanic is accessible to players of all skill levels. High rolls help players claim Ruins, while low rolls help players collect Stones. This opens two paths to victory: claiming sets of Ruins or using Stones to build Wonders. Delver cards help you affect your dice rolls or dice in play, and Wonders can grant abilities that impact the late game.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0olGvNCDk-VmFW2LDOnI_Q__original/img/sugvsPhhLdQrUxD5SH970FN-Fuc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3579391.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0olGvNCDk-VmFW2LDOnI_Q__thumb/img/3J2ogaftEzBzwUO3kyJ7DXH-3HE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3579391.jpg@1.9474@60@2@4
371@Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan@The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord).&#10;&#10;The campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.&#10;&#10;To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:&#10;&#10;        No dice are used&#10;        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.&#10;        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.&#10;        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.&#10;&#10;No dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.&#10;&#10;Legitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.&#10;&#10;The initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.&#10;&#10;Blocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.&#10;&#10;True to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     1 week per 2-player turns&#10;MAP SCALE     Point to point&#10;UNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     2&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;    Mounted Map&#10;    119 wooden pieces&#10;    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets&#10;    110 cards&#10;    Rulebook&#10;    Two player aid cards&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Matthew Calkins&#10;MAP, CARD, &amp; BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;(source: GMT website)&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eMJAona-uXwh6t2AcugGEg__original/img/4LuFgxwxB8OcjoGBWg6_IxFkZ0s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1063508.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eMJAona-uXwh6t2AcugGEg__thumb/img/6qn1NgnJ9inZNfLlrBdWK3FritU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1063508.jpg@2.8075@180@2@2
372@Pipeline@The refinement of oil has long been part of the government-controlled energy sector. Amassed with an incredibly complex and inefficient system of refineries, the government has felt the severe pressures of worldwide demand and the ever-increasing global standards for refinement. Unable to keep up with demand, the government has only one option: privatizing the oil industry.&#10;&#10;This is where you come in. Seeking to capitalize on this new opportunity, in Pipeline you start a company in the oil business. You will focus on building a much more efficient pipeline network in your refinery, hiring experts that provide valuable benefits over your competitors, and managing the logistics of purchasing and selling your refined oil in the various markets. You will need more than strong economic skills &ndash; carefully crafting an interweaving network of pipelines just might ensure your victory!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x39hXnP-GkLN1CDEq932oA__original/img/dns582_OrWD9ZbABtUmXcQOxguQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4227162.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x39hXnP-GkLN1CDEq932oA__thumb/img/xxiGCk0hEUpP3hOtItpKI3sKZfo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4227162.jpg@3.887@120@2@4
373@Mandala@The Mandala: the symbol of an ancient and sacred ritual. Colored sand is laid to create a symbolic map of the world before the pattern is ceremonially destroyed and the sand cast into the river.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game Mandala, you are trying to score more than your opponent by collecting valuable cards &mdash; but you won't know which cards are valuable until well into the game! Over the course of the game, players play their colored cards into the two mandalas, building the central shared mountains and laying cards into their own fields. As soon as a mandala has all six colors, the players take turns choosing the colors in the mountain and adding those cards to their &quot;river&quot; and &quot;cup&quot;. At the end of the game, the cards in your cup are worth points based on the position of their colors in that player's river. The player whose cup is worth more points wins.&#10;&#10;The linen playmat shows two circular mandalas, with each being divided by a horizontal space (the mountain) to create one &quot;field&quot; for each player. The playmat has seven spaces in front of each player to hold their river of single face-up cards and their cup: the stack of face-down cards which they score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player receives a hand of six cards. Each player receives two random cards face down in their cup, then two random cards are dealt face up into the central mountain strip of each mandala.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may play either a single card into one of mountains, or one or more matching cards into one of your fields. All cards played into a mandala must follow the &quot;Rule of Color&quot;: Once a color has been played into one of the three areas of a mandala, then later cards of the same color can be played only into that same area. Thus, once your opponent has played red cards into their field, then you can't play red cards in your field, and neither you nor your opponent can play red cards into the central mountain. If you played a card into a mountain, draw three new cards from the deck at the end of your turn; if you played cards into one of your fields, do not draw new cards.&#10;&#10;A mandala is completed once it contains all six colors of cards. When this happens, the players &quot;destroy&quot; the mandala, taking turns to choose a color present in the mountain and claim all cards of that color. Whoever played more cards in their field chooses first; if tied, the player who did not complete the mandala chooses first. The first time you claim cards of a specific color, lay one of these cards in the lowest-valued empty space in your river, then place the rest into your cup. The spaces in your river are valued 1-6 in order, so cards of the first color you claim will be worth 1 point each, cards of the second color you claim worth 2 points each, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once a mandala has been destroyed and all the colors in the mountain claimed, cards played in the fields are discarded, two new cards are dealt face up into the mountain, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered either when the deck is exhausted or when one player adds a sixth color to their river. Both players then tally the value of all the cards in their cup, based on the position of the colors in their river, and whoever has the higher score wins!&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     1 linen playmat&#10;     108 mandala cards (18 in each of 6 colours)&#10;     2 reference cards&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FZUJ_Ieaw83mpz1eL-dY_g__original/img/FvjnGQH9SpkJ9_FB4frouPOe064=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5056121.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FZUJ_Ieaw83mpz1eL-dY_g__thumb/img/o8B080rjfGtNloX7wMa_IRthuXo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5056121.jpg@1.8105@20@2@2
374@The Princes of Florence@In The Princes of Florence, players attract artists and scholars to their palace while trying to become the most prestigious family in Florence.&#10;&#10;Over seven rounds, players attempt to score points in various ways, with most points being earned by playing profession cards to generate &quot;work points&quot;, which can be exchanged for money or victory points. The game includes a variety of professions, such astronomers, organists, and architects; each profession is attracted to a particular combination of building, landscape feature, and social freedom, and players acquire these items via auctions. The more that a player can match these preferences, the more work points they earn &mdash; but the minimum requirement of work points increases each round, and you must meet that threshold in order to convert the work points.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2VxE_6b8dsoGQ1PWBlZr5A__original/img/qhg1xB3T5SdLpnW6DL0ycfpNjzo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7003069.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2VxE_6b8dsoGQ1PWBlZr5A__thumb/img/FzPvv-goSZi0jhYlsxmeP61Cs5Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7003069.jpg@3.2467@100@2@5

377@Tragedy Looper@Tragedy Looper is a scenario-based deduction game for two to four players: one mastermind and one to three protagonists. The game consists of four location boards and a number of character cards. Each scenario features a number of characters, hidden roles for these characters (serial killer, conspiracy theorist, friend), and some pre-set tragedies (murder, suicide).&#10;&#10;Each &quot;day&quot; (turn), players and the mastermind play three face-down cards onto the characters, then reveal them to move the characters around or affect their paranoia or goodwill stats. At the end of each day (turn), if the scenario has a tragedy set for that day, it happens if the conditions are met, i.e., certain characters have certain stats or are in a certain location together (or not together) with others. As tragedies happen, players loop back in time, restarting the scenario from the beginning and trying to deduce who the culprit was and why the tragedy occurred.&#10;&#10;The players win if they manage to maintain status quo &mdash; that is, if no tragedies occur to the key individuals &mdash; for a set number of days, within a set number of loops. If not, the mastermind wins.&#10;&#10;Tragedy Looper was originally released in Japan as &#230;&#131;&#168;&#229;&#138;&#135;RoopeR in 2011; the first english version of the game was released in 2014.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fsUCwhRp_5knh6eY8EduTw__original/img/FgUk3tNrF0_ryLIT3S0nnZUY8iE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2046290.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fsUCwhRp_5knh6eY8EduTw__thumb/img/_mkrhR0iN7QX5e1LhsPtDbhXhMo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2046290.png@3.5357@120@2@4
378@City of the Big Shoulders@After the great Chicago Fire of 1871, the brave men and women of Chicago sought to rebuild their once-great city, and rebuild it they did. Over the next 60 years Chicago experienced an economic golden age, making such great progress that it hosted The World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, followed not long after by a celebration of its Century of Progress at The World's Fair in 1933.&#10;&#10;Many of the household brands we've come to know and love today had their start in Chicago during this time period; Oscar Mayer, Kraft, Quaker Oats, Nabisco, Swift &amp; Co, Armour &amp; Co, Schwinn Bicycles, Charles Schwab, and many others made a home here in this tall, bold slugger.&#10;&#10;In City of the Big Shoulders players take on the roles of entrepreneurs and investors seeking to rebuild Chicago into a city fit for the world stage. In this unique merger of 18xx-style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire employees, equip their factories, produce goods and sell them to be delivered to homes across the midwest.&#10;&#10;Although City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of strategic depth and rewarding gameplay, it does so in a shorter timeline than is typical of most heavy economic games. Players play just five rounds (also known as decades) in about two and a half hours. Each decade consists of five unique phases: A stock phase where players can buy and sell stock; a building phase where players rebuild the city of Chicago, placing action spaces on the board; an action phase where companies send their partners to make deals across Chicago; an Operating Phase where companies buy resources, produce goods, and ship them out of Chicago; and finally a cleanup phase where the board is set up for the following decade. At the end of the fifth decade, the game ends. Players then exchange shares that they have purchased over the course of the game for cash, are rewarded for any of the public goals they have accomplished over the five decades of play, and tally their money to determine who is Chicago's greatest resident.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JImiygpumS35fVxlfsRPXw__original/img/7uft3DL-UNgIE2MQ_B_RbdsBQKw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4223934.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JImiygpumS35fVxlfsRPXw__thumb/img/4JoMwGJySRhnioxER3OEj6r0uYg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4223934.jpg@4.0134@180@2@4
379@Dinosaur World@The triumph of science that led to dinosaurs returning to the world once more has become public knowledge. New parks spring up regularly, often beginning operations even before everything has been finalized. There is no shortage of patrons eager to be entertained by these returned species in new and exciting ways. However, as with any form of entertainment, elements of triumph are often accompanied by elements of tragedy. This means it is of the utmost importance that you take every precaution by ensuring each visitor signs the safety waiver before enjoying the wonders of Dinosaur World!&#10;&#10;Each round in Dinosaur World, you draft a new r&eacute;sum&eacute; card to acquire new workers; spend workers to take public actions building your park and acquiring DNA; spend further workers to take private actions improving that park; then drive your jeep around experiencing the wonder and excitement of what you have built! Throughout the game you acquire victory points through a variety of means &mdash; and possibly a few visitor deaths as a natural consequence of overly enthusiastic dinosaur encounters. At the end of the game, you lose points if you accumulated too many deaths, then the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q-CvtJOYWZQDw1tuOdDd4Q__original/img/Eo6IIIYE_Ks1AkMS7garjfSXsh4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6020854.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q-CvtJOYWZQDw1tuOdDd4Q__thumb/img/JmOmFgjBhY0rc1ejk7z7Cw1o9Dw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6020854.jpg@3.2447@120@2@4
380@Würfel Bohnanza@W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza is, as you might suspect, a dice game in the Bohnanza family. Instead of cards, dice give you the beans that you must use to satisfy orders and (eventually) collect &quot;Bohnentalers&quot; (i.e., dollars, bucks, dinero...). The first player to collect thirteen Bohnentalers wins.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player receives two order cards, each of which shows six orders; the player tries to complete orders on one card while using the other to cover completed orders. The easiest orders to complete &ndash; say, two specific bean types or three beans in any combination of two types &ndash; are at the bottom of the card, and the hardest ones &ndash; requiring, say, a four-of-a-kind or seven beans with no blue ones &ndash; are at the top. Orders must be completed from bottom to top.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player starts by rolling the seven bean dice, three of which have one combination of beans and four of which have another combination. This player must set aside at least one bean, then she rerolls any remaining dice, setting at least one aside, etc. After at most seven rolls, she completes as many orders as she can, reusing the dice as needed to complete orders. Once a player completes three orders, she can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of four. When a player harvests the order card, she draws a new card and uses that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card she already had.&#10;&#10;In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade. In W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, the active player doesn't trade dice, but opponents do get to benefit from that player's rolls. After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &ndash; and not dice already set aside &ndash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much with her rolls as her opponents might benefit from her turn more than she does.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected thirteen Bohnentalers. The player with the most Bohnentalers wins!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iirbnwkZ755tRj69Q-uWHw__original/img/HxMo6ECz4BlMv8o3RDYWBQax4gs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1197852.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iirbnwkZ755tRj69Q-uWHw__thumb/img/_aACxitODyWc7h1cAKG_c8w9Cjo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1197852.jpg@1.3028@45@2@5

382@Cinque Terre@The Cinque Terre are five coastal villages in the Liguria region of Italy known for their beauty, culture, food, and proximity to one another. Produce carts are commonly found in each village marketplace.&#10;&#10;In Cinque Terre, a game of strategy, players compete to sell the most valuable produce in the five villages. Players act as farmers and operate a cart in which they will harvest produce and deliver them to the five villages to sell. Additionally, players will compete for Produce Order cards, which reward Lira points for selling desirable produce in specific villages. Players track sold produce in each village using their Fulfillment Cards. The winner is the player who gains the most Lire by selling valuable produce, gaining popularity in the villages, and fulfilling Produce Orders.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game Set Up and Play&#10;&#10;During setup in Cinque Terre, colored dice are randomly pulled from a cloth bag and rolled to establish the prices each village will pay for select produce. Each player also begins play with a private order only she can fulfill. Five public orders are turned up that all players can work on, though only the first player to fulfill each public order will score points for it. The Most Popular Vendor cards (1 for each village) are placed face up along one side of the board. The first player to fill an entire row with produce cubes for a particular village earns the Most Popular Vendor card for that village, which provides bonus points. Four Produce cards are turned face up and each player receives 4 to begin with along with a Fulfillment board and Produce Truck in their color.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can perform 3 actions in any order or combination you choose:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take a Produce Card - either a faceup card or one from the deck.&#10;     Move your Produce Cart up four spaces clockwise around the board.&#10;     Harvest produce from the location your cart is currently at. Each produce cube you wish to harvest requires a matching card. Two identical cards can be used in place of any one other card. Your cart can hold up to 4 produce cubes at a time.&#10;     Deliver produce to a village. Unload the produce cubes you wish to deliver and place them in the appropriate spaces for that village on your fulfillment card.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if you complete a public order or achieve Most Popular Vendor, take the appropriate card, scoring the points indicated. You can only complete one public order per turn. When you complete a public order, you must draw a new card from the Order Deck. If you would like to keep that card as a private order, add it to your hand and draw another and place it face up to replace the public order just completed. If you do not wish to keep the card you drew as a private order, place it face up instead. Any private orders not fultilled by game end count as negative points against you.&#10;&#10;Players take turns taking their 3 actions until one player has completed 5 public orders (Most Popular Vendor Cards also count as public orders for determining game end), then everyone gets one more turn, including the player who caused the game to end.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tKGmB7xfdX5g6nv9pfAUmw__original/img/-XemMw8yO-j4aWVwXRywx40D0mA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1299610.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tKGmB7xfdX5g6nv9pfAUmw__thumb/img/Hgci2PVX1zh3qvIwT_D6qOLhtzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1299610.jpg@2.3563@60@2@5
383@Macao@At the end of the 17th century, Macao &ndash; the mysterious port city on the southern coast of China &ndash; is a Portuguese trading post in the Far East. The players take on the role of energetic and daring adventurers. Many exciting tasks and challenges await the players, whether they are a captain, governor, craftsman, or scholar. Those who chose the wisest course of action and have the best overall strategy will earn the most prestige at the end.&#10;&#10;Macao lasts twelve rounds, and in each round players select one new card from a display specific to that round, two of which were revealed at the start of the game and others that were revealed only at the start of the round. The deck of 96 cards includes all sorts of special abilities, with the more powerful actions costing more resources to put into play.&#10;&#10;One player rolls six different-colored dice, then each player selects two of those dice (possibly the same ones chosen by opponents), then places cubes equal to the number and color of the two dice on a personalized &quot;ship's wheel.&quot; For example, if a player chooses the blue die that shows a 5, he places five blue cubes on the ship's wheel position five spots away from the current round. (A player can never claim more cubes than the number of remaining rounds).&#10;&#10;Players rotate their ship's wheels each round, then use the cubes available to them in that round to perform various actions: activating cards selected in that round or earlier rounds, buying city quarters and collecting the goods located there, moving that player's ship around Europe to deliver those goods, acquiring gold coins, taking special actions with card previously activated, and advancing on a turn order track.&#10;&#10;Players score points by delivering goods, paying gold coins, using the powers on their cards, and building in Macao. Whoever has the most points at the end of twelve rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Macao is number 13 in the alea big box series, with an estimated difficulty on the alea scale of 6/10.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jLpm4EaABRAIN7F1Uakfaw__original/img/sOEALnO3ZFAgPdQn5rTE7M4RuWs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic665651.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jLpm4EaABRAIN7F1Uakfaw__thumb/img/_DEcXV8qc02wb7cj20YIVtjDG1w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic665651.jpg@3.1346@100@2@4
384@Memoir '44@Memoir '44  is a historical boardgame where players face-off in stylized battles of some of the most famous historic battles of World War II including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra and the Ardennes.&#10;&#10;Memoir '44 includes over 15 different battle scenarios and features a double-sided hex game board for both beach landings and countryside combat. Each scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.&#10;&#10;&quot;By design, the game is not overly complex&quot;, says Memoir '44 designer, Richard Borg. &quot;The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.&quot; In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir '44 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice.&#10;&#10;Memoir '44 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. And with Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.&#10;&#10;The Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2AjxTtgBtZVst8wOAk1NAA__original/img/Ro6pGYz0WFmCOP5ytZ6Z40KhoZ4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6974498.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2AjxTtgBtZVst8wOAk1NAA__thumb/img/ymrloLOMqIyQYu4JkYkB5T16W1I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6974498.jpg@2.2723@60@2@8

386@Vindication@Vindication (formerly Epoch: The Awakening) is a highly strategic, fantasy-based tabletop journey for 2-5 players. Play time is 15-30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;Thrown overboard for a life of wretchedness, you wash ashore a hostile island ruins &mdash; completely alone with nothing except the breath in your lungs and an undaunted spirit.&#10;&#10;Through your advanced resource management, area control tactics, and freeform action selection, you&rsquo;ll add companions to your party, acquire bizarre relics, attain potent character traits, and defeat a host of unusual monsters in the ultimate goal of mastering heroic attributes &mdash; and regaining honor.&#10;&#10;You may perform 3 actions on each turn in the order you feel is most advantageous that turn:  activate a companion, travel to a new location, and interact with a map tile. Many actions require the the use of your influence to gain attributes in a one-of-a-kind heroic attribute alchemy system, which is leveraged to gain the game's most powerful rewards. For example, you can meditate at a spire to gain inspiration. You can train at a fort to gain strength. But then you can combine your inspiration and strength to gain the courage (inspired strength) which allows you to perform a bounty hunt.&#10;&#10;There are distinctive end-game triggers that can be affected through game play, over 72 unique card abilities that can be merged in unusual ways for potent combinations, and fresh tile placement each game for high replayability.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kEIlWY3rg27NgmVBZkFyg__original/img/LgCwqEKxO2mpOzXf5_6z_pt6vz0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4101638.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kEIlWY3rg27NgmVBZkFyg__thumb/img/NYzya2nOQJaZolgQGxKXiBd_O6g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4101638.jpg@3.0594@150@2@5

388@Magic Maze@Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;After being stripped of all their possessions, a mage, a warrior, an elf, and a dwarf are forced to go rob the local Magic Maze shopping mall for all the equipment necessary for their next adventure. They agree to map out the labyrinth in its entirety first, then find each individual&rsquo;s favorite store, and then locate the exit. In order to evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then dash to the exit. That's the plan anyway&hellip;but can they pull it off?&#10;&#10;Magic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator&hellip; All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wJfDIveg2zpTGn8E1WzEpA__original/img/hlp96WuBfwiCijcfPddNmfgTq6E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3268473.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wJfDIveg2zpTGn8E1WzEpA__thumb/img/Un57jB38oeBZ0WFdd7rXSOEP-1k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3268473.jpg@1.7743@15@1@8
389@Tyrants of the Underdark@Tyrants of the Underdark is a territory control game with a deck-building element.&#10;&#10;Each player leads a house of Drow in a section of the Underdark below the Sword Coast. The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your &quot;inner circle&quot;, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.&#10;&#10;A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.&#10;&#10;Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F58jczp5xk9CYFimrytXaw__original/img/m0S3T9_YWM7VvTW1c3pl4tBiu2c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2801874.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F58jczp5xk9CYFimrytXaw__thumb/img/X2ur4XNMdPRURbaziJ8nQmioNGE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2801874.jpg@2.5665@60@2@4

392@Britannia@&quot;Britannia&quot; is a historical Strategic board-wargame that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066.&#10;&#10;Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain&rsquo;s history in important ways, creating countless interesting &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; scenarios. What if Boudicca&rsquo;s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?&#10;&#10;In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-M-1zs8oMttiUS2xd8qK4A__original/img/Hil6BWCATeo_bcRqRMHGhAsx_mw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic106711.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-M-1zs8oMttiUS2xd8qK4A__thumb/img/qjfnfPFYpTCgmvV9Yon2BDdy88Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic106711.jpg@3.1623@300@3@5
393@Nations: The Dice Game@From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food as the population increases, build a productive economy, and amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!&#10;&#10;Nations: The Dice Game is a game for 1-4 players that takes 10-15 minutes per player and shares many concepts with the civilization-building game Nations while still offering its own challenges. The game is played over four ages (four rounds). During each round, players take turns until all have passed. The available actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Buy a tile&#10;     Build a wonder&#10;     Reroll some or all your dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Buildings and military provide dice. Colonies and wonders provide resources and victory points. Advisors provide rerolls. New tiles provide benefits immediately, so you can roll new dice at once.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, War and Famine drawn at the start of the round is checked for each player, giving you victory points if you match or beat the values. Books are accumulated and scored. Player order is checked, with high military strength going first in the next round. At the end of the game, whoever has the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAUrzJCm1nNzJ_JyH6N85g__original/img/OJ_xr9s3GeMwG4s4rqp7xJrEgpA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3743789.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAUrzJCm1nNzJ_JyH6N85g__thumb/img/mB-g90DCrvuRHH2V8ErYeYwF6p0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3743789.jpg@1.9956@40@1@4

Feige Spiele's warehouse burnt down in early 1983, just before distribution of Willi Sonderling's masterpiece was to be shipped. Only a handful of reviewer copies survived.&#10;&#10;Shortly thereafter there was a very small print run (fewer than a couple hundred) of the German version, das Verschwinden.

395@Steampunk Rally@Steampunk Rally is a strategy game that incorporates steampunk as more than just a bit of chrome. Using a unique dice-placement mechanism, players take on the roles of famous inventors from the turn of the last century like Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie, constructing fantastical contraptions that make use of steam, heat and electricity in an attempt to win a no-holds-barred race through the Swiss alps.&#10;&#10;Each round starts with a card draft in which players carefully select machine parts to add to their invention and one-shot boost cards to aid them or hinder opponents. Players also have the option of discarding drafted cards for dice or cogs to power their invention, but they must make this tricky choice when each card is drafted.&#10;&#10;Then, after venting dice to revitalize their machines, players roll their dice and use them to activate machine parts which provide things like movement, shielding, and additional dice with which to activate more parts. Driving through terrain causes damage, and if a player's damage gauge ends up in the red at the end of the turn, they must lose parts from their invention. These will need to be replaced in the draft phase, constantly forcing players to discover new synergies.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x7ZIq-jb6z10UJiv_8wsyg__original/img/s3KmeeFsWo3DzkaVzfORXEHfGWM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2073821.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x7ZIq-jb6z10UJiv_8wsyg__thumb/img/URNMA8H29TNXaMhjNvxdV4Xvql8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2073821.jpg@2.6066@60@2@8

398@Love Letter@All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess of Tempest. Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, and you must rely on others to take your romantic letters to her. Will yours reach her first?&#10;&#10;Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!&#10;&#10;Number 4 in the Tempest: Shared World Game Series&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T1ltXwapFUtghS9A7_tf4g__original/img/xIAzJY7rl-mtPStRZSqnTVsAr8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1401448.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T1ltXwapFUtghS9A7_tf4g__thumb/img/GtNX7gCmGpw39Tr6JApWC3Aga5U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1401448.jpg@1.1889@20@2@4
399@Dixit@2010 Spiel des Jahres Winner&#10;&#10;One player is the storyteller for the turn and looks at the images on the 6 cards in her hand. From one of these, she makes up a sentence and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players).&#10;&#10;Each other player selects the card in their hands which best matches the sentence and gives the selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others.&#10;&#10;The storyteller shuffles her card with all the received cards. All pictures are shown face up and every player has to bet upon which picture was the storyteller's.&#10;&#10;If nobody or everybody finds the correct card, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players scores 2. Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3. Players score 1 point for every vote for their own card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck is empty or if a player scores 30 points. In either case, the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;The base game and all expansions have 84 cards each.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J0PlHArkZDJ57H-brXW2Fw__original/img/jt3kFCHJ3HJ2079dMLwipFZqdQg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6738336.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J0PlHArkZDJ57H-brXW2Fw__thumb/img/QVwPXskFikQwBQlrdLJBAiRGgdg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6738336.jpg@1.2055@30@3@8
400@Friday@Friday, the second game in the Friedemann Friese Series: Freitag-Project (Friedemann Friese), is based on the story of Robinson Crusoe and his loyal partner Friday (Freitag). You play as Friday, and when Robinson Crusoe crashes his ship on your island, your peaceful times are disturbed. You must help Robinson to survive the island and prepare him to defeat the pirates that are coming for the island.&#10;&#10;Friday is a solitaire deck-building game in which you optimize your deck of fight cards in order to defeat the hazards of the island. During a turn the player will attempt to defeat hazard cards by playing fight cards from their deck. If defeated, a hazard card will become a fight card and is added to the player's deck. If failed, the player will lose life points but also get the opportunity to remove unwanted cards from their fight deck. In the end, the player will use their optimized fight deck to defeat the two pirate ships coming for the island, allowing Robinson Crusoe to escape the island and allowing you to finally have your peace back!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7bBUuYUIyKIBDh_UnNa_Fw__original/img/_tiZYJMEc26kgt7uNF6IM8A-8As=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1513328.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7bBUuYUIyKIBDh_UnNa_Fw__thumb/img/Bjg_3ovfjRqjGtYEaEj6107UGWY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1513328.jpg@2.1484@25@1@1
401@7 Wonders Duel@In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.&#10;&#10;What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7BL8N4-Qqo0RrAVEfBhfrQ__original/img/XAjr-hwbH3U16ydN3bpjadfXK1A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7149683.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7BL8N4-Qqo0RrAVEfBhfrQ__thumb/img/NyEfOiEeV0MeNwaCOOb1uefWQtU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7149683.jpg@2.2227@30@2@2

403@Pandemic@In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3ybV1LAp-8SnHIXLLjVqA__original/img/IsrvRLpUV1TEyZsO5rC-btXaPz0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1534148.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3ybV1LAp-8SnHIXLLjVqA__thumb/img/oqViRj6nVxK3m36NluTxU1PZkrk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1534148.jpg@2.4046@45@2@4
404@Shadows over Camelot@Shadows over Camelot is a cooperative/semi-cooperative hand-management and deduction-based board game for 3&ndash;7 players.&#10;&#10;Each player represents a knight of the Round Table and they must collaborate to overcome a number of quests, ranging from defeating the Black Knight to the search for the Holy Grail. Completed quests place white swords on the Round Table; failed quests add black swords and/or siege engines around Camelot. The knights are trying to build a majority of white swords on the Table before Camelot falls.&#10;&#10;On each knight's turn, the knight takes a &quot;heroic action&quot;, such as moving to a new quest, building his hand, or playing cards to advance the forces of good. However, he must also choose one of three evil actions, each of which will bring Camelot closer to defeat.&#10;&#10;Moreover, one of the knights may be a traitor, pretending to be a loyal member of the party but secretly hindering his fellow knights in subtle ways, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...&#10;&#10;But enough words... don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse, and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JYqwG_v1B3RhpB7NcmeDOA__original/img/_eAaG7PMaTcj1DpHbmUaOBTisoY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic70547.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JYqwG_v1B3RhpB7NcmeDOA__thumb/img/QOG1zO0uvqxGTDF9V_OewVPMvNE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic70547.jpg@2.5668@80@3@7
405@Terraforming Mars@In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wg9oOLcsKvDesSUdZQ4rxw__original/img/thIqWDnH9utKuoKVEUqveDixprI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3536616.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wg9oOLcsKvDesSUdZQ4rxw__thumb/img/BTxqxgYay5tHJfVoJ2NF5g43_gA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3536616.jpg@3.2497@120@1@5
406@Pandemic Legacy: Season 1@Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Qer2BBPG7qGGDu6KcVDIw__original/img/PlzAH7swN1nsFxOXbfUvE3TkE5w=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2452831.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Qer2BBPG7qGGDu6KcVDIw__thumb/img/NQQcjS31TO0DE246N9rpt0hd9eo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2452831.png@2.8311@60@2@4
407@Twilight Struggle@&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;&#10;&ndash; John F. Kennedy&#10;&#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&#10;&#10;Components (original edition):&#10;&#10;&#10;     228 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map &#10;     103 event cards &#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)&#10;&#10;     260 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     110 event cards&#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews&#10;MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:&#10;&#10;     Mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters&#10;     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)&#10;     Revised rules and player aid cards&#10;     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames&#10;&#10;&#10;Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:&#10;&#10;     Mounted Map with revised graphics&#10;     New card decks&#10;     Updated Rules &amp; Charts&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pNCiUUphnoeWOYfsWq0kng__original/img/Iae47UtAd_RXVd5tJ3YzbDHOv4E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3530661.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pNCiUUphnoeWOYfsWq0kng__thumb/img/p7alNkNy8Avm8UISmhYHCiMz5bE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3530661.jpg@3.5994@180@2@2
408@A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)@Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.&#10;&#10;In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.&#10;&#10;Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.&#10;&#10;The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.&#10;&#10;In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.&#10;&#10;Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Dance with Dragons (2012)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Feast for Crows (2013)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; Mother of Dragons (2018)&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones (2003)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)&#10;&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__original/img/3tv6H7jX5T9rqwuI84YZKZDBGcw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1077906.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__thumb/img/ZQ9guRvmMgYfseBC3_xNscMOKKo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1077906.jpg@3.7232@240@3@6
409@Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization@Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.&#10;&#10;Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fVwPntkJKgaEo0rIC0RwpA__original/img/1jawNpljTXwnT4km_2CjGwoUPR8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2663291.jpg@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fVwPntkJKgaEo0rIC0RwpA__thumb/img/31usGlzlBReEFf60bcgbvDTjwCg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2663291.jpg@4.4246@120@2@4
410@Gaia Project@Gaia Project is a new game in the line of Terra Mystica. As in the original Terra Mystica, fourteen different factions live on seven different kinds of planets, and each faction is bound to their own home planets, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring planets into their home environments in competition with the other groups. In addition, Gaia planets can be used by all factions for colonization, and Transdimensional planets can be changed into Gaia planets.&#10;&#10;All factions can improve their skills in six different areas of development &mdash; Terraforming, Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, Gaiaforming, Economy, Research &mdash; leading to advanced technology and special bonuses. To do all of that, each group has special skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;The playing area is made of ten sectors, allowing a variable set-up and thus an even bigger replay value than its predecessor Terra Mystica. A two-player game is hosted on seven sectors.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hGWFm3hbMlCDsfCsauOQ4g__original/img/tjlflQtUPFiTpLpwk1NCVCS29Ic=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5375625.png@https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hGWFm3hbMlCDsfCsauOQ4g__thumb/img/NNG7Ijyx4evp5gcVReis9i0koas=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375625.png@4.3831@150@1@4
